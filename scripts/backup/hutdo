       Local:  rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [DEST]

       Access via remote shell:
         Pull: rsync [OPTION...] [USER@]HOST:SRC... [DEST]
         Push: rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [USER@]HOST:DEST

       Access via rsync daemon:
         Pull: rsync [OPTION...] [USER@]HOST::SRC... [DEST]
               rsync [OPTION...] rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/SRC... [DEST]
         Push: rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [USER@]HOST::DEST
               rsync [OPTION...] SRC... rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/DEST

       Usages with just one SRC arg and no DEST arg will list the source files instead of copying.

       Rsync  is  a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool.  It can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a
       remote rsync daemon.  It offers a large number of options that control every aspect of its behavior and permit very flexible specification of the
       set of files to be copied.  It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only
       the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination.  Rsync is widely used for backups and  mirroring  and  as  an
       improved copy command for everyday use.

       Rsync  finds  files that need to be transferred using a "quick check" algorithm (by default) that looks for files that have changed in size or in
       last-modified time.  Any changes in the other preserved attributes (as requested by options) are made on the destination file directly  when  the
       quick check indicates that the file’s data does not need to be updated.

       Some of the additional features of rsync are:

       o      support for copying links, devices, owners, groups, and permissions

       o      exclude and exclude-from options similar to GNU tar

       o      a CVS exclude mode for ignoring the same files that CVS would ignore

       o      can use any transparent remote shell, including ssh or rsh

       o      does not require super-user privileges

       o      pipelining of file transfers to minimize latency costs

       o      support for anonymous or authenticated rsync daemons (ideal for mirroring)

GGEENNEERRAALL
       Rsync copies files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the current host (it does not support copying files between two remote hosts).

       There are two different ways for rsync to contact a remote system: using a remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or rsh) or contact‐
       ing an rsync daemon directly via TCP.  The remote-shell transport is used whenever the source or destination path contains  a  single  colon  (:)
       separator  after  a  host specification.  Contacting an rsync daemon directly happens when the source or destination path contains a double colon
       (::) separator after a host specification, OR when an rsync:// URL is specified (see also the "USING RSYNC-DAEMON  FEATURES  VIA  A  REMOTE-SHELL
       CONNECTION" section for an exception to this latter rule).

       As a special case, if a single source arg is specified without a destination, the files are listed in an output format similar to "ls -l".

       As expected, if neither the source or destination path specify a remote host, the copy occurs locally (see also the ----lliisstt--oonnllyy option).

       Rsync  refers  to the local side as the "client" and the remote side as the "server".  Don’t confuse "server" with an rsync daemon -- a daemon is
       always a server, but a server can be either a daemon or a remote-shell spawned process.

SSEETTUUPP
       See the file README for installation instructions.

       Once installed, you can use rsync to any machine that you can access via a remote shell (as well as some that you can access using the rsync dae‐
       mon-mode  protocol).   For  remote  transfers, a modern rsync uses ssh for its communications, but it may have been configured to use a different
       remote shell by default, such as rsh or remsh.

       You can also specify any remote shell you like, either by using the --ee command line option, or by setting the RSYNC_RSH environment variable.

       Note that rsync must be installed on both the source and destination machines.

UUSSAAGGEE
       You use rsync in the same way you use rcp. You must specify a source and a destination, one of which may be remote.

       Perhaps the best way to explain the syntax is with some examples:

              rsync -t *.c foo:src/

       This would transfer all files matching the pattern *.c from the current directory to the directory src on the machine foo. If any  of  the  files
       already  exist on the remote system then the rsync remote-update protocol is used to update the file by sending only the differences in the data.
       Note that the expansion of wildcards on the commandline (*.c) into a list of files is handled by the shell before it runs rsync and not by  rsync
       itself (exactly the same as all other posix-style programs).

              rsync -avz foo:src/bar /data/tmp

       This  would  recursively  transfer all files from the directory src/bar on the machine foo into the /data/tmp/bar directory on the local machine.
       The files are transferred in "archive" mode, which ensures that symbolic links, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships, etc. are  preserved
       in the transfer.  Additionally, compression will be used to reduce the size of data portions of the transfer.

              rsync -avz foo:src/bar/ /data/tmp

       A  trailing  slash  on  the  source changes this behavior to avoid creating an additional directory level at the destination.  You can think of a
       trailing / on a source as meaning "copy the contents of this directory" as opposed to "copy the  directory  by  name",  but  in  both  cases  the
       attributes  of  the  containing  directory are transferred to the containing directory on the destination.  In other words, each of the following
       commands copies the files in the same way, including their setting of the attributes of /dest/foo:

              rsync -av /src/foo /dest
              rsync -av /src/foo/ /dest/foo

       Note also that host and module references don’t require a trailing slash to copy the contents of the default directory.   For  example,  both  of
       these copy the remote directory’s contents into "/dest":

              rsync -av host: /dest
              rsync -av host::module /dest

       You  can  also  use rsync in local-only mode, where both the source and destination don’t have a ’:’ in the name. In this case it behaves like an
       improved copy command.

       Finally, you can list all the (listable) modules available from a particular rsync daemon by leaving off the module name:

              rsync somehost.mydomain.com::

       See the following section for more details.

AADDVVAANNCCEEDD UUSSAAGGEE
       The syntax for requesting multiple files from a remote host is done by specifying additional remote-host args in the same style as the first,  or
       with the hostname omitted.  For instance, all these work:

              rsync -av host:file1 :file2 host:file{3,4} /dest/
              rsync -av host::modname/file{1,2} host::modname/file3 /dest/
              rsync -av host::modname/file1 ::modname/file{3,4}

       Older versions of rsync required using quoted spaces in the SRC, like these examples:

              rsync -av host:'dir1/file1 dir2/file2' /dest
              rsync host::'modname/dir1/file1 modname/dir2/file2' /dest

       This word-splitting still works (by default) in the latest rsync, but is not as easy to use as the first method.

       If  you need to transfer a filename that contains whitespace, you can either specify the ----pprrootteecctt--aarrggss (--ss) option, or you’ll need to escape the
       whitespace in a way that the remote shell will understand.  For instance:

              rsync -av host:'file\ name\ with\ spaces' /dest

       It is also possible to use rsync without a remote shell as the transport.  In this case you will directly connect to a remote rsync daemon, typi‐
       cally  using  TCP  port 873.  (This obviously requires the daemon to be running on the remote system, so refer to the STARTING AN RSYNC DAEMON TO
       ACCEPT CONNECTIONS section below for information on that.)

       Using rsync in this way is the same as using it with a remote shell except that:

       o      you either use a double colon :: instead of a single colon to separate the hostname from the path, or you use an rsync:// URL.

       o      the first word of the "path" is actually a module name.

       o      the remote daemon may print a message of the day when you connect.

       o      if you specify no path name on the remote daemon then the list of accessible paths on the daemon will be shown.

       o      if you specify no local destination then a listing of the specified files on the remote daemon is provided.

       o      you must not specify the ----rrsshh (--ee) option.

       An example that copies all the files in a remote module named "src":

           rsync -av host::src /dest

       Some modules on the remote daemon may require authentication. If so, you will receive a password prompt when you connect. You can avoid the pass‐
       word  prompt  by setting the environment variable RSYNC_PASSWORD to the password you want to use or using the ----ppaasssswwoorrdd--ffiillee option. This may be
       useful when scripting rsync.

       WARNING: On some systems environment variables are visible to all users. On those systems using ----ppaasssswwoorrdd--ffiillee is recommended.

       You may establish the connection via a web proxy by setting the environment variable RSYNC_PROXY to a hostname:port pair  pointing  to  your  web
       proxy.  Note that your web proxy’s configuration must support proxy connections to port 873.

       You  may also establish a daemon connection using a program as a proxy by setting the environment variable RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG to the commands you
       wish to run in place of making a direct socket connection.  The string may contain the escape "%H" to represent the  hostname  specified  in  the
       rsync command (so use "%%" if you need a single "%" in your string).  For example:

         export RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG='ssh proxyhost nc %H 873'
         rsync -av targethost1::module/src/ /dest/
         rsync -av rsync:://targethost2/module/src/ /dest/

       The  command specified above uses ssh to run nc (netcat) on a proxyhost, which forwards all data to port 873 (the rsync daemon) on the targethost
       (%H).

       It is sometimes useful to use various features of an rsync daemon (such as named modules) without actually allowing any  new  socket  connections
       into  a  system (other than what is already required to allow remote-shell access).  Rsync supports connecting to a host using a remote shell and
       then spawning a single-use "daemon" server that expects to read its config file in the home dir of the remote user.  This can be  useful  if  you
       want  to encrypt a daemon-style transfer’s data, but since the daemon is started up fresh by the remote user, you may not be able to use features
       such as chroot or change the uid used by the daemon.  (For another way to encrypt a daemon transfer, consider using ssh to tunnel a local port to
       a remote machine and configure a normal rsync daemon on that remote host to only allow connections from "localhost".)

       From  the  user’s  perspective, a daemon transfer via a remote-shell connection uses nearly the same command-line syntax as a normal rsync-daemon
       transfer, with the only exception being that you must explicitly set the remote shell program on the command-line with the ----rrsshh==CCOOMMMMAANNDD  option.
       (Setting the RSYNC_RSH in the environment will not turn on this functionality.)  For example:

           rsync -av --rsh=ssh host::module /dest

       If  you need to specify a different remote-shell user, keep in mind that the user@ prefix in front of the host is specifying the rsync-user value
       (for a module that requires user-based authentication).  This means that you  must  give  the  ’-l  user’  option  to  ssh  when  specifying  the
       remote-shell, as in this example that uses the short version of the ----rrsshh option:

           rsync -av -e "ssh -l ssh-user" rsync-user@host::module /dest

       The "ssh-user" will be used at the ssh level; the "rsync-user" will be used to log-in to the "module".

       In  order  to connect to an rsync daemon, the remote system needs to have a daemon already running (or it needs to have configured something like
       inetd to spawn an rsync daemon for incoming connections on a particular port).  For full information on how to start a daemon that will  handling
       incoming  socket connections, see the rrssyynnccdd..ccoonnff(5) man page -- that is the config file for the daemon, and it contains the full details for how
       to run the daemon (including stand-alone and inetd configurations).

       If you’re using one of the remote-shell transports for the transfer, there is no need to manually start an rsync daemon.

       Rsync always sorts the specified filenames into its internal transfer list.  This handles the merging together of  the  contents  of  identically
       named  directories, makes it easy to remove duplicate filenames, and may confuse someone when the files are transferred in a different order than
       what was given on the command-line.

       If you need a particular file to be transferred prior to another, either separate the  files  into  different  rsync  calls,  or  consider  using
       ----ddeellaayy--uuppddaatteess (which doesn’t affect the sorted transfer order, but does make the final file-updating phase happen much more rapidly).

       Here are some examples of how I use rsync.

       To backup my wife’s home directory, which consists of large MS Word files and mail folders, I use a cron job that runs

              rsync -Cavz . arvidsjaur:backup

       each night over a PPP connection to a duplicate directory on my machine "arvidsjaur".

       To synchronize my samba source trees I use the following Makefile targets:

           get:
                   rsync -avuzb --exclude '*~' samba:samba/ .
           put:
                   rsync -Cavuzb . samba:samba/
           sync: get put

       this allows me to sync with a CVS directory at the other end of the connection. I then do CVS operations on the remote machine, which saves a lot
       of time as the remote CVS protocol isn’t very efficient.

       I mirror a directory between my "old" and "new" ftp sites with the command:

       rsync -az -e ssh --delete ~ftp/pub/samba nimbus:"~ftp/pub/tridge"

       This is launched from cron every few hours.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Rsync accepts both long (double-dash + word) and short (single-dash + letter) options.  The full list of  the  available  options  are  described
       below.  If an option can be specified in more than one way, the choices are comma-separated.  Some options only have a long variant, not a short.
       If the option takes a parameter, the parameter is only listed after the long variant, even though it must also be specified for the short.   When
       specifying  a  parameter,  you can either use the form --option=param or replace the ’=’ with whitespace.  The parameter may need to be quoted in
       some manner for it to survive the shell’s command-line parsing.  Keep in mind that a leading tilde (~) in  a  filename  is  substituted  by  your
       shell, so --option=~/foo will not change the tilde into your home directory (remove the ’=’ for that).

       ----hheellpp Print  a short help page describing the options available in rsync and exit.  For backward-compatibility with older versions of rsync, the
              help will also be output if you use the --hh option without any other args.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              print the rsync version number and exit.

       --vv,, ----vveerrbboossee
              This option increases the amount of information you are given during the transfer.  By default, rsync works silently.  A  single  --vv  will
              give  you  information  about what files are being transferred and a brief summary at the end. Two --vv options will give you information on
              what files are being skipped and slightly more information at the end. More than two --vv options should only be used if you  are  debugging
              rsync.

              In  a modern rsync, the --vv option is equivalent to the setting of groups of ----iinnffoo and ----ddeebbuugg options.  You can choose to use these newer
              options in addition to, or in place of using ----vveerrbboossee, as any fine-grained settings override the implied settings of --vv.  Both ----iinnffoo and
              ----ddeebbuugg have a way to ask for help that tells you exactly what flags are set for each increase in verbosity.

              However, do keep in mind that a daemon’s "max verbosity" setting will limit how high of a level the various individual flags can be set on
              the daemon side.  For instance, if the max is 2, then any info and/or debug flag that is set to a higher value than what would be  set  by
              --vvvv will be downgraded to the --vvvv level in the daemon’s logging.

       ----iinnffoo==FFLLAAGGSS
              This  option lets you have fine-grained control over the information output you want to see.  An individual flag name may be followed by a
              level number, with 0 meaning to silence that output, 1 being the default output level, and higher numbers increasing the  output  of  that
              flag  (for  those that support higher levels).  Use ----iinnffoo==hheellpp to see all the available flag names, what they output, and what flag names
              are added for each increase in the verbose level.  Some examples:

                  rsync -a --info=progress2 src/ dest/
                  rsync -avv --info=stats2,misc1,flist0 src/ dest/

              Note that ----iinnffoo==nnaammee’s output is affected by the ----oouutt--ffoorrmmaatt and ----iitteemmiizzee--cchhaannggeess (--ii) options.  See those options for more information
              on what is output and when.

              This  option  was  added to 3.1.0, so an older rsync on the server side might reject your attempts at fine-grained control (if one or more
              flags needed to be send to the server and the server was too old to understand them).  See also the  "max  verbosity"  caveat  above  when
              dealing with a daemon.

       ----ddeebbuugg==FFLLAAGGSS
              This  option lets you have fine-grained control over the debug output you want to see.  An individual flag name may be followed by a level
              number, with 0 meaning to silence that output, 1 being the default output level, and higher numbers increasing the  output  of  that  flag
              (for  those  that support higher levels).  Use ----ddeebbuugg==hheellpp to see all the available flag names, what they output, and what flag names are
              added for each increase in the verbose level.  Some examples:

                  rsync -avvv --debug=none src/ dest/
                  rsync -avA --del --debug=del2,acl src/ dest/

              Note that some debug messages will only be output when ----mmssggss22ssttddeerrrr is specified, especially those pertaining to I/O  and  buffer  debug‐
              ging.

              This  option  was  added to 3.1.0, so an older rsync on the server side might reject your attempts at fine-grained control (if one or more
              flags needed to be send to the server and the server was too old to understand them).  See also the  "max  verbosity"  caveat  above  when
              dealing with a daemon.

       ----mmssggss22ssttddeerrrr
              This  option  changes  rsync  to  send  all its output directly to stderr rather than to send messages to the client side via the protocol
              (which normally outputs info messages via stdout).  This is mainly intended for debugging in order to avoid changing the data sent via the
              protocol, since the extra protocol data can change what is being tested.  The option does not affect the remote side of a transfer without
              using ----rreemmoottee--ooppttiioonn -- e.g. --MM----mmssggss22ssttddeerrrr.  Also keep in mind that a daemon connection does not have a stderr channel to send messages
              back  to  the  client  side,  so  if  you  are  doing  any daemon-transfer debugging using this option, you should start up a daemon using
              ----nnoo--ddeettaacchh so that you can see the stderr output on the daemon side.

              This option has the side-effect of making stderr output get line-buffered so that the merging of the output of 3  programs  happens  in  a
              more readable manner.

       --qq,, ----qquuiieett
              This  option  decreases  the  amount  of  information you are given during the transfer, notably suppressing information messages from the
              remote server. This option is useful when invoking rsync from cron.

       ----nnoo--mmoottdd
              This option affects the information that is output by  the  client  at  the  start  of  a  daemon  transfer.   This  suppresses  the  mes‐
              sage-of-the-day  (MOTD) text, but it also affects the list of modules that the daemon sends in response to the "rsync host::" request (due
              to a limitation in the rsync protocol), so omit this option if you want to request the list of modules from the daemon.

       --II,, ----iiggnnoorree--ttiimmeess
              Normally rsync will skip any files that are already the same size and have the same modification timestamp.  This option  turns  off  this
              "quick check" behavior, causing all files to be updated.

       ----ssiizzee--oonnllyy
              This  modifies rsync’s "quick check" algorithm for finding files that need to be transferred, changing it from the default of transferring
              files with either a changed size or a changed last-modified time to just looking for files that have changed in size.  This is useful when
              starting to use rsync after using another mirroring system which may not preserve timestamps exactly.

       ----mmooddiiffyy--wwiinnddooww
              When comparing two timestamps, rsync treats the timestamps as being equal if they differ by no more than the modify-window value.  This is
              normally 0 (for an exact match), but you may find it useful to set this to a larger value in some situations.  In particular, when  trans‐
              ferring to or from an MS Windows FAT filesystem (which represents times with a 2-second resolution), ----mmooddiiffyy--wwiinnddooww==11 is useful (allowing
              times to differ by up to 1 second).

       --cc,, ----cchheecckkssuumm
              This changes the way rsync checks if the files have been changed and are in need of a transfer.  Without this option, rsync uses a  "quick
              check"  that  (by  default)  checks  if each file’s size and time of last modification match between the sender and receiver.  This option
              changes this to compare a 128-bit checksum for each file that has a matching size.  Generating the checksums means that  both  sides  will
              expend a lot of disk I/O reading all the data in the files in the transfer (and this is prior to any reading that will be done to transfer
              changed files), so this can slow things down significantly.

              The sending side generates its checksums while it is doing the file-system scan that builds the list of the available files.  The receiver
              generates  its  checksums  when  it  is scanning for changed files, and will checksum any file that has the same size as the corresponding
              sender’s file:  files with either a changed size or a changed checksum are selected for transfer.

              Note that rsync always verifies that each _t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r_r_e_d file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving  side  by  checking  a  whole-file
              checksum  that  is  generated  as  the file is transferred, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this
              option’s before-the-transfer "Does this file need to be updated?" check.

              For protocol 30 and beyond (first supported in 3.0.0), the checksum used is MD5.  For older protocols, the checksum used is MD4.

       --aa,, ----aarrcchhiivvee
              This is equivalent to --rrllppttggooDD. It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and want to preserve almost everything  (with  -H  being  a
              notable omission).  The only exception to the above equivalence is when ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm is specified, in which case --rr is not implied.

              Note that --aa ddooeess nnoott pprreesseerrvvee hhaarrddlliinnkkss, because finding multiply-linked files is expensive.  You must separately specify --HH.

       --no-OPTION
              You  may turn off one or more implied options by prefixing the option name with "no-".  Not all options may be prefixed with a "no-": only
              options that are implied by  other  options  (e.g.  ----nnoo--DD,  ----nnoo--ppeerrmmss)  or  have  different  defaults  in  various  circumstances  (e.g.
              ----nnoo--wwhhoollee--ffiillee,  ----nnoo--bblloocckkiinngg--iioo,  ----nnoo--ddiirrss).   You  may  specify either the short or the long option name after the "no-" prefix (e.g.
              ----nnoo--RR is the same as ----nnoo--rreellaattiivvee).

              For example: if you want to use --aa (----aarrcchhiivvee) but don’t want --oo (----oowwnneerr), instead of converting --aa into --rrllppttggDD, you  could  specify  --aa
              ----nnoo--oo (or --aa ----nnoo--oowwnneerr).

              The  order  of the options is important:  if you specify ----nnoo--rr --aa, the --rr option would end up being turned on, the opposite of --aa ----nnoo--rr.
              Note also that the side-effects of the ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm option are NOT positional, as it affects the default  state  of  several  options  and
              slightly changes the meaning of --aa (see the ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm option for more details).

       --rr,, ----rreeccuurrssiivvee
              This tells rsync to copy directories recursively.  See also ----ddiirrss (--dd).

              Beginning  with rsync 3.0.0, the recursive algorithm used is now an incremental scan that uses much less memory than before and begins the
              transfer after the scanning of the first few directories have been completed.  This incremental scan only affects our recursion algorithm,
              and does not change a non-recursive transfer.  It is also only possible when both ends of the transfer are at least version 3.0.0.

              Some  options  require  rsync  to  know  the  full  file  list,  so  these options disable the incremental recursion mode.  These include:
              ----ddeelleettee--bbeeffoorree, ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr, ----pprruunnee--eemmppttyy--ddiirrss, and ----ddeellaayy--uuppddaatteess.  Because of this, the  default  delete  mode  when  you  specify
              ----ddeelleettee is now ----ddeelleettee--dduurriinngg when both ends of the connection are at least 3.0.0 (use ----ddeell or ----ddeelleettee--dduurriinngg to request this improved
              deletion mode explicitly).  See also the ----ddeelleettee--ddeellaayy option that is a better choice than using ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr.

              Incremental recursion can be disabled using the ----nnoo--iinncc--rreeccuurrssiivvee option or its shorter ----nnoo--ii--rr alias.

       --RR,, ----rreellaattiivvee
              Use relative paths. This means that the full path names specified on the command line are sent to the server rather  than  just  the  last
              parts  of the filenames. This is particularly useful when you want to send several different directories at the same time. For example, if
              you used this command:

                 rsync -av /foo/bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/

              ... this would create a file named baz.c in /tmp/ on the remote machine. If instead you used

                 rsync -avR /foo/bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/

              then a file named /tmp/foo/bar/baz.c would be created on the remote machine, preserving its full path.   These  extra  path  elements  are
              called "implied directories" (i.e. the "foo" and the "foo/bar" directories in the above example).

              Beginning  with  rsync 3.0.0, rsync always sends these implied directories as real directories in the file list, even if a path element is
              really a symlink on the sending side.  This prevents some really unexpected behaviors when copying the full path of a file that you didn’t
              realize  had  a  symlink in its path.  If you want to duplicate a server-side symlink, include both the symlink via its path, and referent
              directory via its real path.  If you’re dealing with an older rsync on the sending side, you may need to use the ----nnoo--iimmpplliieedd--ddiirrss option.

              It is also possible to limit the amount of path information that is sent as implied directories for each path you specify.  With a  modern
              rsync on the sending side (beginning with 2.6.7), you can insert a dot and a slash into the source path, like this:

                 rsync -avR /foo/./bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/

              That would create /tmp/bar/baz.c on the remote machine.  (Note that the dot must be followed by a slash, so "/foo/." would not be abbrevi‐
              ated.)  For older rsync versions, you would need to use a chdir to limit the source path.  For example, when pushing files:

                 (cd /foo; rsync -avR bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/)

              (Note that the parens put the two commands into a sub-shell, so that the "cd" command doesn’t remain in effect for future  commands.)   If
              you’re pulling files from an older rsync, use this idiom (but only for a non-daemon transfer):

                 rsync -avR --rsync-path="cd /foo; rsync" \
                     remote:bar/baz.c /tmp/

       ----nnoo--iimmpplliieedd--ddiirrss
              This  option  affects the default behavior of the ----rreellaattiivvee option.  When it is specified, the attributes of the implied directories from
              the source names are not included in the transfer.  This means that the corresponding path elements on the  destination  system  are  left
              unchanged  if  they  exist,  and any missing implied directories are created with default attributes.  This even allows these implied path
              elements to have big differences, such as being a symlink to a directory on the receiving side.

              For instance, if a command-line arg or a files-from entry told rsync to transfer the file  "path/foo/file",  the  directories  "path"  and
              "path/foo"  are implied when ----rreellaattiivvee is used.  If "path/foo" is a symlink to "bar" on the destination system, the receiving rsync would
              ordinarily delete "path/foo", recreate it as a directory, and receive the file  into  the  new  directory.   With  ----nnoo--iimmpplliieedd--ddiirrss,  the
              receiving  rsync  updates "path/foo/file" using the existing path elements, which means that the file ends up being created in "path/bar".
              Another way to accomplish this link preservation is to use the ----kkeeeepp--ddiirrlliinnkkss option (which will also affect symlinks to  directories  in
              the rest of the transfer).

              When  pulling  files  from  an  rsync  older than 3.0.0, you may need to use this option if the sending side has a symlink in the path you
              request and you wish the implied directories to be transferred as normal directories.

       --bb,, ----bbaacckkuupp
              With this option, preexisting destination files are renamed as each file is transferred or deleted.  You can control where the backup file
              goes and what (if any) suffix gets appended using the ----bbaacckkuupp--ddiirr and ----ssuuffffiixx options.

              Note that if you don’t specify ----bbaacckkuupp--ddiirr, (1) the ----oommiitt--ddiirr--ttiimmeess option will be implied, and (2) if ----ddeelleettee is also in effect (with‐
              out ----ddeelleettee--eexxcclluuddeedd), rsync will add a "protect" filter-rule for the backup suffix to the end of all your existing excludes (e.g. --ff  ""PP
              **~~"").   This  will  prevent  previously backed-up files from being deleted.  Note that if you are supplying your own filter rules, you may
              need to manually insert your own exclude/protect rule somewhere higher up in the list so that it has a high enough priority to  be  effec‐
              tive (e.g., if your rules specify a trailing inclusion/exclusion of ’*’, the auto-added rule would never be reached).

       ----bbaacckkuupp--ddiirr==DDIIRR
              In combination with the ----bbaacckkuupp option, this tells rsync to store all backups in the specified directory on the receiving side.  This can
              be used for incremental backups.  You can additionally specify a backup suffix using the ----ssuuffffiixx option (otherwise the files backed up in
              the specified directory will keep their original filenames).

              Note  that  if  you  specify  a relative path, the backup directory will be relative to the destination directory, so you probably want to
              specify either an absolute path or a path that starts with "../".  If an rsync daemon is the receiver, the backup dir  cannot  go  outside
              the module’s path hierarchy, so take extra care not to delete it or copy into it.

       ----ssuuffffiixx==SSUUFFFFIIXX
              This  option  allows  you  to  override  the  default  backup  suffix  used with the ----bbaacckkuupp (--bb) option. The default suffix is a ~ if no
              ---bbaacckkuupp--ddiirr was specified, otherwise it is an empty string.

       --uu,, ----uuppddaattee
              This forces rsync to skip any files which exist on the destination and have a modified time that is newer than the source  file.   (If  an
              existing destination file has a modification time equal to the source file’s, it will be updated if the sizes are different.)

              Note  that  this  does  not  affect  the copying of dirs, symlinks, or other special files.  Also, a difference of file format between the
              sender and receiver is always considered to be important enough for an update, no matter what date is on the objects.  In other words,  if
              the source has a directory where the destination has a file, the transfer would occur regardless of the timestamps.

              This  option  is  a transfer rule, not an exclude, so it doesn’t affect the data that goes into the file-lists, and thus it doesn’t affect
              deletions.  It just limits the files that the receiver requests to be transferred.

       ----iinnppllaaccee
              This option changes how rsync transfers a file when its data needs to be updated: instead of the default method of creating a new copy  of
              the file and moving it into place when it is complete, rsync instead writes the updated data directly to the destination file.

              This has several effects:

              o      Hard  links  are  not broken.  This means the new data will be visible through other hard links to the destination file.  Moreover,
                     attempts to copy differing source files onto a multiply-linked destination file will result in a "tug of war" with the  destination
                     data changing back and forth.

              o      In-use  binaries  cannot be updated (either the OS will prevent this from happening, or binaries that attempt to swap-in their data
                     will misbehave or crash).

              o      The file’s data will be in an inconsistent state during the transfer and will be left that way if the transfer is interrupted or if
                     an update fails.

              o      A  file  that  rsync  cannot  write to cannot be updated. While a super user can update any file, a normal user needs to be granted
                     write permission for the open of the file for writing to be successful.

              o      The efficiency of rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm may be reduced if some data in the destination file is overwritten before it can
                     be  copied to a position later in the file.  This does not apply if you use ----bbaacckkuupp, since rsync is smart enough to use the backup
                     file as the basis file for the transfer.

              WARNING: you should not use this option to update files that are being accessed by others, so be careful when choosing to use this  for  a
              copy.

              This option is useful for transferring large files with block-based changes or appended data, and also on systems that are disk bound, not
              network bound.  It can also help keep a copy-on-write filesystem snapshot from diverging the entire contents of a file that only has minor
              changes.

              The  option  implies  ----ppaarrttiiaall  (since  an  interrupted  transfer  does  not  delete  the  file),  but  conflicts  with ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr and
              ----ddeellaayy--uuppddaatteess.  Prior to rsync 2.6.4 ----iinnppllaaccee was also incompatible with ----ccoommppaarree--ddeesstt and ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt.

       ----aappppeenndd
              This causes rsync to update a file by appending data onto the end of the file, which presumes that the data that  already  exists  on  the
              receiving  side  is  identical  with  the  start  of  the file on the sending side.  If a file needs to be transferred and its size on the
              receiver is the same or longer than the size on the sender, the file is skipped.  This does not interfere with the updating  of  a  file’s
              non-content  attributes (e.g. permissions, ownership, etc.) when the file does not need to be transferred, nor does it affect the updating
              of any non-regular files.  Implies ----iinnppllaaccee, but does not conflict with ----ssppaarrssee (since it is always extending a file’s length).

              The use of ----aappppeenndd can be dangerous if you aren’t 100% sure that the files that are longer have only grown by the appending of data  onto
              the  end.   You  should  thus  use include/exclude/filter rules to ensure that such a transfer is only affecting files that you know to be
              growing via appended data.

       ----aappppeenndd--vveerriiffyy
              This works just like the ----aappppeenndd option, but the existing data on the receiving side is included in the full-file  checksum  verification
              step, which will cause a file to be resent if the final verification step fails (rsync uses a normal, non-appending ----iinnppllaaccee transfer for
              the resend).

              Note: prior to rsync 3.0.0, the ----aappppeenndd option worked like ----aappppeenndd--vveerriiffyy, so if you are interacting with an older rsync (or the  trans‐
              fer is using a protocol prior to 30), specifying either append option will initiate an ----aappppeenndd--vveerriiffyy transfer.

       --dd,, ----ddiirrss
              Tell  the  sending side to include any directories that are encountered.  Unlike ----rreeccuurrssiivvee, a directory’s contents are not copied unless
              the directory name specified is "." or ends with a trailing slash (e.g. ".", "dir/.", "dir/", etc.).  Without this option or the  ----rreeccuurr‐‐
              ssiivvee option, rsync will skip all directories it encounters (and output a message to that effect for each one).  If you specify both ----ddiirrss
              and ----rreeccuurrssiivvee, ----rreeccuurrssiivvee takes precedence.

              The ----ddiirrss option is implied by the ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm option or the ----lliisstt--oonnllyy option (including an implied ----lliisstt--oonnllyy usage) if  ----rreeccuurrssiivvee
              wasn’t specified (so that directories are seen in the listing).  Specify ----nnoo--ddiirrss (or ----nnoo--dd) if you want to turn this off.

              There  is  also a backward-compatibility helper option, ----oolldd--ddiirrss (or ----oolldd--dd) that tells rsync to use a hack of "-r --exclude=’/*/*’" to
              get an older rsync to list a single directory without recursing.

       --ll,, ----lliinnkkss
              When symlinks are encountered, recreate the symlink on the destination.

       --LL,, ----ccooppyy--lliinnkkss
              When symlinks are encountered, the item that they point to (the referent) is copied, rather than the symlink.  In older versions of rsync,
              this option also had the side-effect of telling the receiving side to follow symlinks, such as symlinks to directories.  In a modern rsync
              such as this one, you’ll need to specify ----kkeeeepp--ddiirrlliinnkkss (--KK) to get this extra behavior.  The only exception is when sending files to  an
              rsync that is too old to understand --KK -- in that case, the --LL option will still have the side-effect of --KK on that older receiving rsync.

       ----ccooppyy--uunnssaaffee--lliinnkkss
              This tells rsync to copy the referent of symbolic links that point outside the copied tree.  Absolute symlinks are also treated like ordi‐
              nary files, and so are any symlinks in the source path itself  when  ----rreellaattiivvee  is  used.   This  option  has  no  additional  effect  if
              ----ccooppyy--lliinnkkss was also specified.

       ----ssaaffee--lliinnkkss
              This  tells  rsync  to  ignore  any symbolic links which point outside the copied tree. All absolute symlinks are also ignored. Using this
              option in conjunction with ----rreellaattiivvee may give unexpected results.

       ----mmuunnggee--lliinnkkss
              This option tells rsync to (1) modify all symlinks on the receiving side in a way that makes them unusable but recoverable (see below), or
              (2) to unmunge symlinks on the sending side that had been stored in a munged state.  This is useful if you don’t quite trust the source of
              the data to not try to slip in a symlink to a unexpected place.

              The way rsync disables the use of symlinks is to prefix each one with the string "/rsyncd-munged/".  This prevents the  links  from  being
              used  as  long  as  that directory does not exist.  When this option is enabled, rsync will refuse to run if that path is a directory or a
              symlink to a directory.

              The option only affects the client side of the transfer, so if you need it to affect the server, specify it  via  ----rreemmoottee--ooppttiioonn.   (Note
              that in a local transfer, the client side is the sender.)

              This  option  has  no affect on a daemon, since the daemon configures whether it wants munged symlinks via its "munge symlinks" parameter.
              See also the "munge-symlinks" perl script in the support directory of the source code.

       --kk,, ----ccooppyy--ddiirrlliinnkkss
              This option causes the sending side to treat a symlink to a directory as though it were a real directory.  This is  useful  if  you  don’t
              want symlinks to non-directories to be affected, as they would be using ----ccooppyy--lliinnkkss.

              Without  this  option, if the sending side has replaced a directory with a symlink to a directory, the receiving side will delete anything
              that is in the way of the new symlink, including a directory hierarchy (as long as ----ffoorrccee or ----ddeelleettee is in effect).

              See also ----kkeeeepp--ddiirrlliinnkkss for an analogous option for the receiving side.

              ----ccooppyy--ddiirrlliinnkkss applies to all symlinks to directories in the source.  If you want to follow only a few specified symlinks,  a  trick  you
              can use is to pass them as additional source args with a trailing slash, using ----rreellaattiivvee to make the paths match up right.  For example:

              rsync -r --relative src/./ src/./follow-me/ dest/

              This  works because rsync calls llssttaatt(2) on the source arg as given, and the trailing slash makes llssttaatt(2) follow the symlink, giving rise
              to a directory in the file-list which overrides the symlink found during the scan of "src/./".

       --KK,, ----kkeeeepp--ddiirrlliinnkkss
              This option causes the receiving side to treat a symlink to a directory as though it were a real directory, but only if it matches a  real
              directory from the sender.  Without this option, the receiver’s symlink would be deleted and replaced with a real directory.

              For  example,  suppose  you  transfer  a  directory  "foo"  that  contains a file "file", but "foo" is a symlink to directory "bar" on the
              receiver.  Without ----kkeeeepp--ddiirrlliinnkkss, the receiver deletes symlink "foo", recreates it as a directory, and receives the file  into  the  new
              directory.  With ----kkeeeepp--ddiirrlliinnkkss, the receiver keeps the symlink and "file" ends up in "bar".

              One note of caution:  if you use ----kkeeeepp--ddiirrlliinnkkss, you must trust all the symlinks in the copy!  If it is possible for an untrusted user to
              create their own symlink to any directory, the user could then (on a subsequent copy) replace the symlink with a real directory and affect
              the content of whatever directory the symlink references.  For backup copies, you are better off using something like a bind mount instead
              of a symlink to modify your receiving hierarchy.

              See also ----ccooppyy--ddiirrlliinnkkss for an analogous option for the sending side.

       --HH,, ----hhaarrdd--lliinnkkss
              This tells rsync to look for hard-linked files in the source and link together the corresponding files on the destination.   Without  this
              option, hard-linked files in the source are treated as though they were separate files.

              This  option  does  NOT necessarily ensure that the pattern of hard links on the destination exactly matches that on the source.  Cases in
              which the destination may end up with extra hard links include the following:

              o      If the destination contains extraneous hard-links (more linking than what is present in the source file list),  the  copying  algo‐
                     rithm  will  not  break  them  explicitly.   However,  if one or more of the paths have content differences, the normal file-update
                     process will break those extra links (unless you are using the ----iinnppllaaccee option).

              o      If you specify a ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt directory that contains hard links, the linking of the destination files against the ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt files
                     can cause some paths in the destination to become linked together due to the ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt associations.

              Note  that  rsync  can  only  detect  hard  links  between files that are inside the transfer set.  If rsync updates a file that has extra
              hard-link connections to files outside the transfer, that linkage will be broken.  If you are tempted to use the ----iinnppllaaccee option to avoid
              this  breakage,  be  very careful that you know how your files are being updated so that you are certain that no unintended changes happen
              due to lingering hard links (and see the ----iinnppllaaccee option for more caveats).

              If incremental recursion is active (see ----rreeccuurrssiivvee), rsync may transfer a missing hard-linked file before it finds that another link  for
              that  contents  exists  elsewhere  in  the hierarchy.  This does not affect the accuracy of the transfer (i.e. which files are hard-linked
              together), just its efficiency (i.e. copying the data for a new, early copy of a hard-linked file that could have been found later in  the
              transfer in another member of the hard-linked set of files).  One way to avoid this inefficiency is to disable incremental recursion using
              the ----nnoo--iinncc--rreeccuurrssiivvee option.

       --pp,, ----ppeerrmmss
              This option causes the receiving rsync to set the destination permissions to be the same as the source permissions.  (See also the ----cchhmmoodd
              option for a way to modify what rsync considers to be the source permissions.)

              When this option is _o_f_f, permissions are set as follows:

              o      Existing files (including updated files) retain their existing permissions, though the ----eexxeeccuuttaabbiilliittyy option might change just the
                     execute permission for the file.

              o      New files get their "normal" permission bits set to the source file’s permissions masked with  the  receiving  directory’s  default
                     permissions  (either  the receiving process’s umask, or the permissions specified via the destination directory’s default ACL), and
                     their special permission bits disabled except in the case where a new directory inherits a setgid bit from its parent directory.

              Thus, when ----ppeerrmmss and ----eexxeeccuuttaabbiilliittyy are both disabled, rsync’s behavior is the same as that of other file-copy utilities, such as ccpp(1)
              and ttaarr(1).

              In  summary:  to give destination files (both old and new) the source permissions, use ----ppeerrmmss.  To give new files the destination-default
              permissions (while leaving existing files unchanged), make sure that the ----ppeerrmmss option is off and use ----cchhmmoodd==uuggoo==rrwwXX (which ensures that
              all  non-masked  bits get enabled).  If you’d care to make this latter behavior easier to type, you could define a popt alias for it, such
              as putting this line in the file ~/.popt (the following defines the --ZZ option, and includes --no-g to use the default group of the  desti‐
              nation dir):

                 rsync alias -Z --no-p --no-g --chmod=ugo=rwX

              You could then use this new option in a command such as this one:

                 rsync -avZ src/ dest/

              (Caveat: make sure that --aa does not follow --ZZ, or it will re-enable the two "--no-*" options mentioned above.)

              The  preservation  of the destination’s setgid bit on newly-created directories when ----ppeerrmmss is off was added in rsync 2.6.7.  Older rsync
              versions erroneously preserved the three special permission bits for newly-created files when ----ppeerrmmss was off, while overriding the desti‐
              nation’s setgid bit setting on a newly-created directory.  Default ACL observance was added to the ACL patch for rsync 2.6.7, so older (or
              non-ACL-enabled) rsyncs use the umask even if default ACLs are present.  (Keep in mind that it is the version of the receiving rsync  that
              affects these behaviors.)

       --EE,, ----eexxeeccuuttaabbiilliittyy
              This  option  causes  rsync  to preserve the executability (or non-executability) of regular files when ----ppeerrmmss is not enabled.  A regular
              file is considered to be executable if at least one ’x’ is turned on in its permissions.  When an existing destination file’s  executabil‐
              ity differs from that of the corresponding source file, rsync modifies the destination file’s permissions as follows:

              o      To make a file non-executable, rsync turns off all its ’x’ permissions.

              o      To make a file executable, rsync turns on each ’x’ permission that has a corresponding ’r’ permission enabled.

              If ----ppeerrmmss is enabled, this option is ignored.

       --AA,, ----aaccllss
              This option causes rsync to update the destination ACLs to be the same as the source ACLs.  The option also implies ----ppeerrmmss.

              The  source  and destination systems must have compatible ACL entries for this option to work properly.  See the ----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr option for a
              way to backup and restore ACLs that are not compatible.

       --XX,, ----xxaattttrrss
              This option causes rsync to update the destination extended attributes to be the same as the source ones.

              For systems that support extended-attribute namespaces, a copy being done by a super-user copies all namespaces except system.*.  A normal
              user  only  copies  the  user.*  namespace.   To  be able to backup and restore non-user namespaces as a normal user, see the ----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr
              option.

              Note that this option does not copy rsyncs special xattr values (e.g. those used by ----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr) unless you repeat the option (e.g. -XX).
              This "copy all xattrs" mode cannot be used with ----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr.

       ----cchhmmoodd
              This  option tells rsync to apply one or more comma-separated "chmod" modes to the permission of the files in the transfer.  The resulting
              value is treated as though it were the permissions that the sending side supplied for the file, which means that this option can  seem  to
              have no effect on existing files if ----ppeerrmmss is not enabled.

              In  addition  to the normal parsing rules specified in the cchhmmoodd(1) manpage, you can specify an item that should only apply to a directory
              by prefixing it with a ’D’, or specify an item that should only apply to a file by prefixing it with a ’F’.  For  example,  the  following
              will ensure that all directories get marked set-gid, that no files are other-writable, that both are user-writable and group-writable, and
              that both have consistent executability across all bits:

              --chmod=Dg+s,ug+w,Fo-w,+X

              Using octal mode numbers is also allowed:

              --chmod=D2775,F664

              It is also legal to specify multiple ----cchhmmoodd options, as each additional option is just appended to the list of changes to make.

              See the ----ppeerrmmss and ----eexxeeccuuttaabbiilliittyy options for how the resulting permission value can be applied to the files in the transfer.

       --oo,, ----oowwnneerr
              This option causes rsync to set the owner of the destination file to be the same as the source file, but only if the  receiving  rsync  is
              being  run  as  the  super-user (see also the ----ssuuppeerr and ----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr options).  Without this option, the owner of new and/or transferred
              files are set to the invoking user on the receiving side.

              The preservation of ownership will associate matching names by default, but may fall back to using the ID  number  in  some  circumstances
              (see also the ----nnuummeerriicc--iiddss option for a full discussion).

       --gg,, ----ggrroouupp
              This option causes rsync to set the group of the destination file to be the same as the source file.  If the receiving program is not run‐
              ning as the super-user (or if ----nnoo--ssuuppeerr was specified), only groups that the invoking user on the receiving side is a member of  will  be
              preserved.  Without this option, the group is set to the default group of the invoking user on the receiving side.

              The  preservation  of group information will associate matching names by default, but may fall back to using the ID number in some circum‐
              stances (see also the ----nnuummeerriicc--iiddss option for a full discussion).

       ----ddeevviicceess
              This option causes rsync to transfer character and block device files to the remote system to recreate these devices.  This option has  no
              effect if the receiving rsync is not run as the super-user (see also the ----ssuuppeerr and ----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr options).

       ----ssppeecciiaallss
              This option causes rsync to transfer special files such as named sockets and fifos.

       --DD     The --DD option is equivalent to ----ddeevviicceess ----ssppeecciiaallss.

       --tt,, ----ttiimmeess
              This  tells  rsync  to transfer modification times along with the files and update them on the remote system.  Note that if this option is
              not used, the optimization that excludes files that have not been modified cannot be effective; in other words, a missing --tt  or  --aa  will
              cause the next transfer to behave as if it used --II, causing all files to be updated (though rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm will make the
              update fairly efficient if the files haven’t actually changed, you’re much better off using --tt).

       --OO,, ----oommiitt--ddiirr--ttiimmeess
              This tells rsync to omit directories when it is preserving modification times (see ----ttiimmeess).  If NFS is sharing  the  directories  on  the
              receiving side, it is a good idea to use --OO.  This option is inferred if you use ----bbaacckkuupp without ----bbaacckkuupp--ddiirr.

              This  option also has the side-effect of avoiding early creation of directories in incremental recursion copies.  The default ----iinncc--rreeccuurr‐‐
              ssiivvee copying normally does an early-create pass of all the sub-directories in a parent directory in order for it to be able  to  then  set
              the  modify  time of the parent directory right away (without having to delay that until a bunch of recursive copying has finished).  This
              early-create idiom is not necessary if directory modify times are not being preserved, so it is skipped.  Since  early-create  directories
              don’t have accurate mode, mtime, or ownership, the use of this option can help when someone wants to avoid these partially-finished direc‐
              tories.

       --JJ,, ----oommiitt--lliinnkk--ttiimmeess
              This tells rsync to omit symlinks when it is preserving modification times (see ----ttiimmeess).

       ----ssuuppeerr
              This tells the receiving side to attempt super-user activities even if the receiving rsync wasn’t run by the super-user.  These activities
              include:  preserving users via the ----oowwnneerr option, preserving all groups (not just the current user’s groups) via the ----ggrroouuppss option, and
              copying devices via the ----ddeevviicceess option.  This is useful for systems that allow such activities without being the  super-user,  and  also
              for  ensuring  that  you  will get errors if the receiving side isn’t being run as the super-user.  To turn off super-user activities, the
              super-user can use ----nnoo--ssuuppeerr.

       ----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr
              When this option is enabled, rsync simulates super-user activities by saving/restoring the  privileged  attributes  via  special  extended
              attributes  that  are  attached to each file (as needed).  This includes the file’s owner and group (if it is not the default), the file’s
              device info (device & special files are created as empty text files), and any permission bits that we won’t allow to be set  on  the  real
              file  (e.g.   the  real  file  gets  u-s,g-s,o-t  for safety) or that would limit the owner’s access (since the real super-user can always
              access/change a file, the files we create can always be accessed/changed by the creating user).  This option also handles ACLs (if  ----aaccllss
              was specified) and non-user extended attributes (if ----xxaattttrrss was specified).

              This is a good way to backup data without using a super-user, and to store ACLs from incompatible systems.

              The  ----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr  option only affects the side where the option is used.  To affect the remote side of a remote-shell connection, use the
              ----rreemmoottee--ooppttiioonn (--MM) option:

                rsync -av -M--fake-super /src/ host:/dest/

              For a local copy, this option affects both the source and the destination.  If you wish a local copy to enable this option  just  for  the
              destination files, specify --MM----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr.  If you wish a local copy to enable this option just for the source files, combine ----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr
              with --MM----ssuuppeerr.

              This option is overridden by both ----ssuuppeerr and ----nnoo--ssuuppeerr.

              See also the "fake super" setting in the daemon’s rsyncd.conf file.

       --SS,, ----ssppaarrssee
              Try to handle sparse files efficiently so they take up less space on the destination.  Conflicts with ----iinnppllaaccee because it’s not  possible
              to overwrite data in a sparse fashion.

       ----pprreeaallllooccaattee
              This  tells  the receiver to allocate each destination file to its eventual size before writing data to the file.  Rsync will only use the
              real filesystem-level preallocation support provided by Linux’s ffaallllooccaattee(2) system call or  Cygwin’s  ppoossiixx__ffaallllooccaattee(3),  not  the  slow
              glibc implementation that writes a zero byte into each block.

              Without  this  option,  larger  files may not be entirely contiguous on the filesystem, but with this option rsync will probably copy more
              slowly.  If the destination is not an extent-supporting filesystem (such as ext4, xfs, NTFS, etc.),  this  option  may  have  no  positive
              effect at all.

       --nn,, ----ddrryy--rruunn
              This  makes  rsync perform a trial run that doesn’t make any changes (and produces mostly the same output as a real run).  It is most com‐
              monly used in combination with the --vv,, ----vveerrbboossee and/or --ii,, ----iitteemmiizzee--cchhaannggeess options to see what an rsync command is going to  do  before
              one actually runs it.

              The  output  of  ----iitteemmiizzee--cchhaannggeess is supposed to be exactly the same on a dry run and a subsequent real run (barring intentional trickery
              and system call failures); if it isn’t, that’s a bug.  Other output should be mostly unchanged, but may differ in some areas.  Notably,  a
              dry run does not send the actual data for file transfers, so ----pprrooggrreessss has no effect, the "bytes sent", "bytes received", "literal data",
              and "matched data" statistics are too small, and the "speedup" value is equivalent to a run where no file transfers were needed.

       --WW,, ----wwhhoollee--ffiillee
              With this option rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm is not used and the whole file is sent as-is instead.  The transfer  may  be  faster  if
              this  option  is used when the bandwidth between the source and destination machines is higher than the bandwidth to disk (especially when
              the "disk" is actually a networked filesystem).  This is the default when both the source and destination are specified  as  local  paths,
              but only if no batch-writing option is in effect.

       --xx,, ----oonnee--ffiillee--ssyysstteemm
              This  tells rsync to avoid crossing a filesystem boundary when recursing.  This does not limit the user’s ability to specify items to copy
              from multiple filesystems, just rsync’s recursion through the hierarchy of each directory that the user specified, and also the  analogous
              recursion  on  the  receiving side during deletion.  Also keep in mind that rsync treats a "bind" mount to the same device as being on the
              same filesystem.

              If this option is repeated, rsync omits all mount-point directories from the copy.  Otherwise, it includes  an  empty  directory  at  each
              mount-point  it  encounters (using the attributes of the mounted directory because those of the underlying mount-point directory are inac‐
              cessible).

              If rsync has been told to collapse symlinks (via ----ccooppyy--lliinnkkss or ----ccooppyy--uunnssaaffee--lliinnkkss), a symlink to  a  directory  on  another  device  is
              treated like a mount-point.  Symlinks to non-directories are unaffected by this option.

       ----eexxiissttiinngg,, ----iiggnnoorree--nnoonn--eexxiissttiinngg
              This tells rsync to skip creating files (including directories) that do not exist yet on the destination.  If this option is combined with
              the ----iiggnnoorree--eexxiissttiinngg option, no files will be updated (which can be useful if all you want to do is delete extraneous files).

              This option is a transfer rule, not an exclude, so it doesn’t affect the data that goes into the file-lists, and thus  it  doesn’t  affect
              deletions.  It just limits the files that the receiver requests to be transferred.

       ----iiggnnoorree--eexxiissttiinngg
              This tells rsync to skip updating files that already exist on the destination (this does _n_o_t ignore existing directories, or nothing would
              get done).  See also ----eexxiissttiinngg.

              This option is a transfer rule, not an exclude, so it doesn’t affect the data that goes into the file-lists, and thus  it  doesn’t  affect
              deletions.  It just limits the files that the receiver requests to be transferred.

              This  option  can  be  useful for those doing backups using the ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt option when they need to continue a backup run that got inter‐
              rupted.  Since a ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt run is copied into a new directory hierarchy (when it is used properly), using ----iiggnnoorree eexxiissttiinngg will  ensure
              that  the  already-handled  files  don’t get tweaked (which avoids a change in permissions on the hard-linked files).  This does mean that
              this option is only looking at the existing files in the destination hierarchy itself.

       ----rreemmoovvee--ssoouurrccee--ffiilleess
              This tells rsync to remove from the sending side the files (meaning non-directories) that are a part of the transfer and  have  been  suc‐
              cessfully duplicated on the receiving side.

              Note  that you should only use this option on source files that are quiescent.  If you are using this to move files that show up in a par‐
              ticular directory over to another host, make sure that the finished files get renamed into the source directory, not directly written into
              it,  so  that  rsync  can’t  possibly  transfer a file that is not yet fully written.  If you can’t first write the files into a different
              directory, you should use a naming idiom that lets rsync avoid transferring files that are not yet finished (e.g. name the file  "foo.new"
              when it is written, rename it to "foo" when it is done, and then use the option ----eexxcclluuddee==''**..nneeww'' for the rsync transfer).

              Starting  with  3.1.0,  rsync  will  skip  the  sender-side removal (and output an error) if the file’s size or modify time has not stayed
              unchanged.

       ----ddeelleettee
              This tells rsync to delete extraneous files from the receiving side (ones that aren’t on the sending side), but only for  the  directories
              that  are  being  synchronized.  You must have asked rsync to send the whole directory (e.g. "dir" or "dir/") without using a wildcard for
              the directory’s contents (e.g. "dir/*") since the wildcard is expanded by the shell and rsync thus gets a request to  transfer  individual
              files, not the files’ parent directory.  Files that are excluded from the transfer are also excluded from being deleted unless you use the
              ----ddeelleettee--eexxcclluuddeedd option or mark the rules as only matching on the sending side (see the include/exclude modifiers  in  the  FILTER  RULES
              section).

              Prior  to  rsync  2.6.7, this option would have no effect unless ----rreeccuurrssiivvee was enabled.  Beginning with 2.6.7, deletions will also occur
              when ----ddiirrss (--dd) is enabled, but only for directories whose contents are being copied.

              This option can be dangerous if used incorrectly!  It is a very good idea to first try a run using the ----ddrryy--rruunn option (--nn) to  see  what
              files are going to be deleted.

              If  the  sending side detects any I/O errors, then the deletion of any files at the destination will be automatically disabled. This is to
              prevent temporary filesystem failures (such as NFS errors) on the sending side from causing a massive deletion of files  on  the  destina‐
              tion.  You can override this with the ----iiggnnoorree--eerrrroorrss option.

              The  ----ddeelleettee  option  may  be combined with one of the --delete-WHEN options without conflict, as well as ----ddeelleettee--eexxcclluuddeedd.  However, if
              none of the --delete-WHEN options are specified, rsync will choose the ----ddeelleettee--dduurriinngg algorithm when talking to rsync 3.0.0 or newer, and
              the ----ddeelleettee--bbeeffoorree algorithm when talking to an older rsync.  See also ----ddeelleettee--ddeellaayy and ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr.

       ----ddeelleettee--bbeeffoorree
              Request  that  the  file-deletions  on  the  receiving  side be done before the transfer starts.  See ----ddeelleettee (which is implied) for more
              details on file-deletion.

              Deleting before the transfer is helpful if the filesystem is tight for space and removing extraneous files would help to make the transfer
              possible.   However,  it  does  introduce a delay before the start of the transfer, and this delay might cause the transfer to timeout (if
              ----ttiimmeeoouutt was specified).  It also forces rsync to use the old, non-incremental recursion algorithm that requires rsync to  scan  all  the
              files in the transfer into memory at once (see ----rreeccuurrssiivvee).

       ----ddeelleettee--dduurriinngg,, ----ddeell
              Request  that  the  file-deletions  on the receiving side be done incrementally as the transfer happens.  The per-directory delete scan is
              done right before each directory is checked for updates, so it behaves like a more efficient ----ddeelleettee--bbeeffoorree, including  doing  the  dele‐
              tions  prior to any per-directory filter files being updated.  This option was first added in rsync version 2.6.4.  See ----ddeelleettee (which is
              implied) for more details on file-deletion.

       ----ddeelleettee--ddeellaayy
              Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be computed during the transfer (like ----ddeelleettee--dduurriinngg), and then removed  after  the
              transfer  completes.   This  is  useful when combined with ----ddeellaayy--uuppddaatteess and/or ----ffuuzzzzyy, and is more efficient than using ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr
              (but can behave differently, since ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr computes the deletions in a separate pass after all updates are done).  If the number of
              removed  files overflows an internal buffer, a temporary file will be created on the receiving side to hold the names (it is removed while
              open, so you shouldn’t see it during the transfer).  If the creation of the temporary file fails, rsync will try to  fall  back  to  using
              ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr  (which  it  cannot  do  if ----rreeccuurrssiivvee is doing an incremental scan).  See ----ddeelleettee (which is implied) for more details on
              file-deletion.

       ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr
              Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done after the transfer has completed.  This is useful if  you  are  sending  new
              per-directory  merge  files  as  a  part  of the transfer and you want their exclusions to take effect for the delete phase of the current
              transfer.  It also forces rsync to use the old, non-incremental recursion algorithm that requires rsync to  scan  all  the  files  in  the
              transfer into memory at once (see ----rreeccuurrssiivvee).  See ----ddeelleettee (which is implied) for more details on file-deletion.

       ----ddeelleettee--eexxcclluuddeedd
              In addition to deleting the files on the receiving side that are not on the sending side, this tells rsync to also delete any files on the
              receiving side that are excluded (see ----eexxcclluuddee).  See the FILTER RULES section for a way to make individual exclusions behave this way on
              the receiver, and for a way to protect files from ----ddeelleettee--eexxcclluuddeedd.  See ----ddeelleettee (which is implied) for more details on file-deletion.

       ----iiggnnoorree--mmiissssiinngg--aarrggss
              When rsync is first processing the explicitly requested source files (e.g. command-line arguments or ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm entries), it is normally
              an error if the file cannot be found.  This option suppresses that error, and does not try to transfer the file.   This  does  not  affect
              subsequent vanished-file errors if a file was initially found to be present and later is no longer there.

       ----ddeelleettee--mmiissssiinngg--aarrggss
              This  option  takes  the  behavior  of (the implied) ----iiggnnoorree--mmiissssiinngg--aarrggss option a step farther:  each missing arg will become a deletion
              request of the corresponding destination file on the receiving side (should it exist).  If the destination file is a non-empty  directory,
              it  will only be successfully deleted if --force or --delete are in effect.  Other than that, this option is independent of any other type
              of delete processing.

              The missing source files are represented by special file-list entries which display as a "*missing" entry in the ----lliisstt--oonnllyy output.

       ----iiggnnoorree--eerrrroorrss
              Tells ----ddeelleettee to go ahead and delete files even when there are I/O errors.

       ----ffoorrccee
              This option tells rsync to delete a non-empty directory when it is to be replaced by a non-directory.  This is only relevant if  deletions
              are not active (see ----ddeelleettee for details).

              Note  for  older  rsync versions: ----ffoorrccee used to still be required when using ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr, and it used to be non-functional unless the
              ----rreeccuurrssiivvee option was also enabled.

       ----mmaaxx--ddeelleettee==NNUUMM
              This tells rsync not to delete more than NUM files or directories.  If that limit is exceeded, all further deletions are  skipped  through
              the end of the transfer.  At the end, rsync outputs a warning (including a count of the skipped deletions) and exits with an error code of
              25 (unless some more important error condition also occurred).

              Beginning with version 3.0.0, you may specify ----mmaaxx--ddeelleettee==00 to be warned about any extraneous files in the destination  without  removing
              any of them.  Older clients interpreted this as "unlimited", so if you don’t know what version the client is, you can use the less obvious
              ----mmaaxx--ddeelleettee==--11 as a backward-compatible way to specify that no deletions be allowed (though really old  versions  didn’t  warn  when  the
              limit was exceeded).

       ----mmaaxx--ssiizzee==SSIIZZEE
              This  tells  rsync  to avoid transferring any file that is larger than the specified SIZE. The SIZE value can be suffixed with a string to
              indicate a size multiplier, and may be a fractional value (e.g. "----mmaaxx--ssiizzee==11..55mm").

              This option is a transfer rule, not an exclude, so it doesn’t affect the data that goes into the file-lists, and thus  it  doesn’t  affect
              deletions.  It just limits the files that the receiver requests to be transferred.

              The  suffixes  are  as  follows:  "K"  (or  "KiB") is a kibibyte (1024), "M" (or "MiB") is a mebibyte (1024*1024), and "G" (or "GiB") is a
              gibibyte (1024*1024*1024).  If you want the multiplier to be 1000 instead of 1024, use "KB", "MB", or "GB".   (Note:  lower-case  is  also
              accepted  for  all  values.)   Finally,  if  the suffix ends in either "+1" or "-1", the value will be offset by one byte in the indicated
              direction.

              Examples: --max-size=1.5mb-1 is 1499999 bytes, and --max-size=2g+1 is 2147483649 bytes.

              Note that rsync versions prior to 3.1.0 did not allow ----mmaaxx--ssiizzee==00.

       ----mmiinn--ssiizzee==SSIIZZEE
              This tells rsync to avoid transferring any file that is smaller than the specified SIZE, which can help in not  transferring  small,  junk
              files.  See the ----mmaaxx--ssiizzee option for a description of SIZE and other information.

              Note that rsync versions prior to 3.1.0 did not allow ----mmiinn--ssiizzee==00.

       --BB,, ----bblloocckk--ssiizzee==BBLLOOCCKKSSIIZZEE
              This  forces  the block size used in rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm to a fixed value.  It is normally selected based on the size of each
              file being updated.  See the technical report for details.

       --ee,, ----rrsshh==CCOOMMMMAANNDD
              This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell program to use for communication between  the  local  and  remote  copies  of
              rsync. Typically, rsync is configured to use ssh by default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network.

              If  this  option  is  used  with [[uusseerr@@]]hhoosstt::::mmoodduullee//ppaatthh, then the remote shell _C_O_M_M_A_N_D will be used to run an rsync daemon on the remote
              host, and all data will be transmitted through that remote shell connection, rather than through a direct socket connection to  a  running
              rsync daemon on the remote host.  See the section "USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION" above.

              Command-line  arguments  are  permitted  in COMMAND provided that COMMAND is presented to rsync as a single argument.  You must use spaces
              (not tabs or other whitespace) to separate the command and args from each other, and you can use single- and/or double-quotes to  preserve
              spaces  in  an  argument (but not backslashes).  Note that doubling a single-quote inside a single-quoted string gives you a single-quote;
              likewise for double-quotes (though you need to pay attention to which quotes your shell is parsing and which  quotes  rsync  is  parsing).
              Some examples:

                  -e 'ssh -p 2234'
                  -e 'ssh -o "ProxyCommand nohup ssh firewall nc -w1 %h %p"'

              (Note that ssh users can alternately customize site-specific connect options in their .ssh/config file.)

              You can also choose the remote shell program using the RSYNC_RSH environment variable, which accepts the same range of values as --ee.

              See also the ----bblloocckkiinngg--iioo option which is affected by this option.

       ----rrssyynncc--ppaatthh==PPRROOGGRRAAMM
              Use  this  to  specify  what  program  is  to be run on the remote machine to start-up rsync.  Often used when rsync is not in the default
              remote-shell’s path (e.g. --rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync).  Note that PROGRAM is run with the help of a shell, so it can  be  any  pro‐
              gram,  script, or command sequence you’d care to run, so long as it does not corrupt the standard-in & standard-out that rsync is using to
              communicate.

              One tricky example is to set a different default directory on the remote machine for use with the ----rreellaattiivvee option.  For instance:

                  rsync -avR --rsync-path="cd /a/b && rsync" host:c/d /e/

       --MM,, ----rreemmoottee--ooppttiioonn==OOPPTTIIOONN
              This option is used for more advanced situations where you want certain effects to be limited to one  side  of  the  transfer  only.   For
              instance, if you want to pass ----lloogg--ffiillee==FFIILLEE and ----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr to the remote system, specify it like this:

                  rsync -av -M --log-file=foo -M--fake-super src/ dest/

              If  you  want  to  have  an  option affect only the local side of a transfer when it normally affects both sides, send its negation to the
              remote side.  Like this:

                  rsync -av -x -M--no-x src/ dest/

              Be cautious using this, as it is possible to toggle an option that will cause rsync to have a different idea about  what  data  to  expect
              next over the socket, and that will make it fail in a cryptic fashion.

              Note  that  it  is  best  to  use a separate ----rreemmoottee--ooppttiioonn for each option you want to pass.  This makes your useage compatible with the
              ----pprrootteecctt--aarrggss option.  If that option is off, any spaces in your remote options will be split by the remote shell unless you  take  steps
              to protect them.

              When performing a local transfer, the "local" side is the sender and the "remote" side is the receiver.

              Note  some versions of the popt option-parsing library have a bug in them that prevents you from using an adjacent arg with an equal in it
              next to a short option letter (e.g. -M--log-file=/tmp/foo.  If this bug affects your version of popt, you can use the version of popt that
              is included with rsync.

       --CC,, ----ccvvss--eexxcclluuddee
              This  is  a useful shorthand for excluding a broad range of files that you often don’t want to transfer between systems. It uses a similar
              algorithm to CVS to determine if a file should be ignored.

              The exclude list is initialized to exclude the following items (these initial items are marked as perishable -- see the FILTER RULES  sec‐
              tion):

                     RCS  SCCS  CVS CVS.adm RCSLOG cvslog.* tags TAGS .make.state .nse_depinfo *~ #* .#* ,* _$* *$ *.old *.bak *.BAK *.orig *.rej .del-*
                     *.a *.olb *.o *.obj *.so *.exe *.Z *.elc *.ln core .svn/ .git/ .hg/ .bzr/

              then, files listed in a $HOME/.cvsignore are added to the list and any files listed in the CVSIGNORE environment variable  (all  cvsignore
              names are delimited by whitespace).

              Finally,  any  file is ignored if it is in the same directory as a .cvsignore file and matches one of the patterns listed therein.  Unlike
              rsync’s filter/exclude files, these patterns are split on whitespace.  See the ccvvss(1) manual for more information.

              If you’re combining --CC with your own ----ffiilltteerr rules, you should note that these CVS excludes are appended at the end of  your  own  rules,
              regardless  of where the --CC was placed on the command-line.  This makes them a lower priority than any rules you specified explicitly.  If
              you want to control where these CVS excludes get inserted into your filter rules, you should omit the --CC as a command-line option and  use
              a  combination  of  ----ffiilltteerr==::CC and ----ffiilltteerr==--CC (either on your command-line or by putting the ":C" and "-C" rules into a filter file with
              your other rules).  The first option turns on the per-directory scanning for the .cvsignore file.   The  second  option  does  a  one-time
              import of the CVS excludes mentioned above.

       --ff,, ----ffiilltteerr==RRUULLEE
              This  option allows you to add rules to selectively exclude certain files from the list of files to be transferred. This is most useful in
              combination with a recursive transfer.

              You may use as many ----ffiilltteerr options on the command line as you like to build up the list of files to exclude.   If  the  filter  contains
              whitespace, be sure to quote it so that the shell gives the rule to rsync as a single argument.  The text below also mentions that you can
              use an underscore to replace the space that separates a rule from its arg.

              See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on this option.

       --FF     The --FF option is a shorthand for adding two ----ffiilltteerr rules to your command.  The first time it is used is a shorthand for this rule:

                 --filter='dir-merge /.rsync-filter'

              This tells rsync to look for per-directory .rsync-filter files that have been sprinkled through the hierarchy and use their rules to  fil‐
              ter the files in the transfer.  If --FF is repeated, it is a shorthand for this rule:

                 --filter='exclude .rsync-filter'

              This filters out the .rsync-filter files themselves from the transfer.

              See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on how these options work.

       ----eexxcclluuddee==PPAATTTTEERRNN
              This  option  is a simplified form of the ----ffiilltteerr option that defaults to an exclude rule and does not allow the full rule-parsing syntax
              of normal filter rules.

              See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on this option.

       ----eexxcclluuddee--ffrroomm==FFIILLEE
              This option is related to the ----eexxcclluuddee option, but it specifies a FILE that contains exclude patterns (one per line).  Blank lines in the
              file and lines starting with ’;’ or ’#’ are ignored.  If _F_I_L_E is --, the list will be read from standard input.

       ----iinncclluuddee==PPAATTTTEERRNN
              This  option  is a simplified form of the ----ffiilltteerr option that defaults to an include rule and does not allow the full rule-parsing syntax
              of normal filter rules.

              See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on this option.

       ----iinncclluuddee--ffrroomm==FFIILLEE
              This option is related to the ----iinncclluuddee option, but it specifies a FILE that contains include patterns (one per line).  Blank lines in the
              file and lines starting with ’;’ or ’#’ are ignored.  If _F_I_L_E is --, the list will be read from standard input.

       ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm==FFIILLEE
              Using this option allows you to specify the exact list of files to transfer (as read from the specified FILE or -- for standard input).  It
              also tweaks the default behavior of rsync to make transferring just the specified files and directories easier:

              o      The ----rreellaattiivvee (--RR) option is implied, which preserves the path information that is specified  for  each  item  in  the  file  (use
                     ----nnoo--rreellaattiivvee or ----nnoo--RR if you want to turn that off).

              o      The ----ddiirrss (--dd) option is implied, which will create directories specified in the list on the destination rather than noisily skip‐
                     ping them (use ----nnoo--ddiirrss or ----nnoo--dd if you want to turn that off).

              o      The ----aarrcchhiivvee (--aa) option’s behavior does not imply ----rreeccuurrssiivvee (--rr), so specify it explicitly, if you want it.

              o      These side-effects change the default state of rsync, so the position of the ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm option on the command-line has no bearing
                     on how other options are parsed (e.g. --aa works the same before or after ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm, as does ----nnoo--RR and all other options).

              The filenames that are read from the FILE are all relative to the source dir -- any leading slashes are removed and no ".." references are
              allowed to go higher than the source dir.  For example, take this command:

                 rsync -a --files-from=/tmp/foo /usr remote:/backup

              If /tmp/foo contains the string "bin" (or even "/bin"), the /usr/bin directory will be created as /backup/bin on the remote host.   If  it
              contains  "bin/"  (note  the trailing slash), the immediate contents of the directory would also be sent (without needing to be explicitly
              mentioned in the file -- this began in version 2.6.4).  In both cases, if the --rr option was enabled, that  dir’s  entire  hierarchy  would
              also  be  transferred (keep in mind that --rr needs to be specified explicitly with ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm, since it is not implied by --aa).  Also note
              that the effect of the (enabled by default) ----rreellaattiivvee option is to duplicate only the path info that is read from the file -- it does not
              force the duplication of the source-spec path (/usr in this case).

              In  addition,  the  ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm  file can be read from the remote host instead of the local host if you specify a "host:" in front of the
              file (the host must match one end of the transfer).  As a short-cut, you can specify just a prefix of ":" to mean "use the remote  end  of
              the transfer".  For example:

                 rsync -a --files-from=:/path/file-list src:/ /tmp/copy

              This would copy all the files specified in the /path/file-list file that was located on the remote "src" host.

              If  the ----iiccoonnvv and ----pprrootteecctt--aarrggss options are specified and the ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm filenames are being sent from one host to another, the file‐
              names will be translated from the sending host’s charset to the receiving host’s charset.

              NOTE: sorting the list of files in the --files-from input helps rsync to be more efficient, as it will avoid re-visiting the path elements
              that  are  shared between adjacent entries.  If the input is not sorted, some path elements (implied directories) may end up being scanned
              multiple times, and rsync will eventually unduplicate them after they get turned into file-list elements.

       --00,, ----ffrroomm00
              This tells rsync that the rules/filenames it reads from a file are terminated by a null (’\0’) character, not a NL, CR,  or  CR+LF.   This
              affects ----eexxcclluuddee--ffrroomm, ----iinncclluuddee--ffrroomm, ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm, and any merged files specified in a ----ffiilltteerr rule.  It does not affect ----ccvvss--eexxcclluuddee
              (since all names read from a .cvsignore file are split on whitespace).

       --ss,, ----pprrootteecctt--aarrggss
              This option sends all filenames and most options to the remote rsync without allowing the remote shell to interpret them.  This means that
              spaces  are  not  split  in  names,  and any non-wildcard special characters are not translated (such as ~, $, ;, &, etc.).  Wildcards are
              expanded on the remote host by rsync (instead of the shell doing it).

              If you use this option with ----iiccoonnvv, the args related to the remote side will also be translated from the  local  to  the  remote  charac‐
              ter-set.  The translation happens before wild-cards are expanded.  See also the ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm option.

              You may also control this option via the RSYNC_PROTECT_ARGS environment variable.  If this variable has a non-zero value, this option will
              be enabled by default, otherwise it will be disabled by default.  Either state is overridden by a manually specified positive or  negative
              version  of  this  option  (note  that ----nnoo--ss and ----nnoo--pprrootteecctt--aarrggss are the negative versions).  Since this option was first introduced in
              3.0.0, you’ll need to make sure it’s disabled if you ever need to interact with a remote rsync that is older than that.

              Rsync can also be configured (at build time) to have this option enabled by default (with is overridden by both the  environment  and  the
              command-line).  This option will eventually become a new default setting at some as-yet-undetermined point in the future.

       --TT,, ----tteemmpp--ddiirr==DDIIRR
              This  option  instructs  rsync  to use DIR as a scratch directory when creating temporary copies of the files transferred on the receiving
              side.  The default behavior is to create each temporary file in the same directory as the associated  destination  file.   Beginning  with
              rsync  3.1.1,  the  temp-file  names inside the specified DIR will not be prefixed with an extra dot (though they will still have a random
              suffix added).

              This option is most often used when the receiving disk partition does not have enough free space to hold a copy of the largest file in the
              transfer.  In this case (i.e. when the scratch directory is on a different disk partition), rsync will not be able to rename each received
              temporary file over the top of the associated destination file, but instead must copy it into place.  Rsync does this by copying the  file
              over  the  top  of the destination file, which means that the destination file will contain truncated data during this copy.  If this were
              not done this way (even if the destination file were first removed, the data locally copied to a temporary file in the destination  direc‐
              tory,  and  then  renamed into place) it would be possible for the old file to continue taking up disk space (if someone had it open), and
              thus there might not be enough room to fit the new version on the disk at the same time.

              If you are using this option for reasons other than a shortage of disk space, you may wish to combine it with the ----ddeellaayy--uuppddaatteess  option,
              which  will  ensure  that all copied files get put into subdirectories in the destination hierarchy, awaiting the end of the transfer.  If
              you don’t have enough room to duplicate all the arriving files on the destination partition, another way to tell  rsync  that  you  aren’t
              overly concerned about disk space is to use the ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr option with a relative path; because this tells rsync that it is OK to stash
              off a copy of a single file in a subdir in the destination hierarchy, rsync will use the partial-dir as a staging area to bring  over  the
              copied file, and then rename it into place from there. (Specifying a ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr with an absolute path does not have this side-effect.)

       --yy,, ----ffuuzzzzyy
              This option tells rsync that it should look for a basis file for any destination file that is missing.  The current algorithm looks in the
              same directory as the destination file for either a file that has an identical size and modified-time,  or  a  similarly-named  file.   If
              found, rsync uses the fuzzy basis file to try to speed up the transfer.

              If  the  option  is  repeated,  the  fuzzy scan will also be done in any matching alternate destination directories that are specified via
              ----ccoommppaarree--ddeesstt, ----ccooppyy--ddeesstt, or ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt.

              Note that the use of the ----ddeelleettee option might get rid of any potential fuzzy-match files, so either use ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr  or  specify  some
              filename exclusions if you need to prevent this.

       ----ccoommppaarree--ddeesstt==DDIIRR
              This  option  instructs  rsync to use _D_I_R on the destination machine as an additional hierarchy to compare destination files against doing
              transfers (if the files are missing in the destination directory).  If a file is found in _D_I_R that is identical to the sender’s file,  the
              file  will  NOT  be transferred to the destination directory.  This is useful for creating a sparse backup of just files that have changed
              from an earlier backup.  This option is typically used to copy into an empty (or newly created) directory.

              Beginning in version 2.6.4, multiple ----ccoommppaarree--ddeesstt directories may be provided, which will cause rsync to search the list  in  the  order
              specified for an exact match.  If a match is found that differs only in attributes, a local copy is made and the attributes updated.  If a
              match is not found, a basis file from one of the _D_I_Rs will be selected to try to speed up the transfer.

              If _D_I_R is a relative path, it is relative to the destination directory.  See also ----ccooppyy--ddeesstt and ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt.

              NOTE: beginning with version 3.1.0, rsync will remove a file from a non-empty destination hierarchy if an exact match is found in  one  of
              the compare-dest hierarchies (making the end result more closely match a fresh copy).

       ----ccooppyy--ddeesstt==DDIIRR
              This  option behaves like ----ccoommppaarree--ddeesstt, but rsync will also copy unchanged files found in _D_I_R to the destination directory using a local
              copy.  This is useful for doing transfers to a new destination while leaving existing files intact, and then doing  a  flash-cutover  when
              all files have been successfully transferred.

              Multiple  ----ccooppyy--ddeesstt directories may be provided, which will cause rsync to search the list in the order specified for an unchanged file.
              If a match is not found, a basis file from one of the _D_I_Rs will be selected to try to speed up the transfer.

              If _D_I_R is a relative path, it is relative to the destination directory.  See also ----ccoommppaarree--ddeesstt and ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt.

       ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt==DDIIRR
              This option behaves like ----ccooppyy--ddeesstt, but unchanged files are hard linked from _D_I_R to the destination directory.  The files must be  iden‐
              tical in all preserved attributes (e.g. permissions, possibly ownership) in order for the files to be linked together.  An example:

                rsync -av --link-dest=$PWD/prior_dir host:src_dir/ new_dir/

              If  file’s  aren’t  linking,  double-check their attributes.  Also check if some attributes are getting forced outside of rsync’s control,
              such a mount option that squishes root to a single user, or mounts a removable drive with generic ownership (such as OS X’s "Ignore owner‐
              ship on this volume" option).

              Beginning in version 2.6.4, multiple ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt directories may be provided, which will cause rsync to search the list in the order spec‐
              ified for an exact match.  If a match is found that differs only in attributes, a local copy is made and the  attributes  updated.   If  a
              match is not found, a basis file from one of the _D_I_Rs will be selected to try to speed up the transfer.

              This  option works best when copying into an empty destination hierarchy, as existing files may get their attributes tweaked, and that can
              affect alternate destination files via hard-links.  Also, itemizing of changes can get a bit muddled.  Note that prior to  version  3.1.0,
              an alternate-directory exact match would never be found (nor linked into the destination) when a destination file already exists.

              Note  that  if  you  combine this option with ----iiggnnoorree--ttiimmeess, rsync will not link any files together because it only links identical files
              together as a substitute for transferring the file, never as an additional check after the file is updated.

              If _D_I_R is a relative path, it is relative to the destination directory.  See also ----ccoommppaarree--ddeesstt and ----ccooppyy--ddeesstt.

              Note that rsync versions prior to 2.6.1 had a bug that could prevent ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt from working properly for a non-super-user  when  --oo  was
              specified (or implied by --aa).  You can work-around this bug by avoiding the --oo option when sending to an old rsync.

       --zz,, ----ccoommpprreessss
              With  this  option, rsync compresses the file data as it is sent to the destination machine, which reduces the amount of data being trans‐
              mitted -- something that is useful over a slow connection.

              Note that this option typically achieves better compression ratios than can be achieved by using a compressing remote shell or a compress‐
              ing  transport  because  it  takes advantage of the implicit information in the matching data blocks that are not explicitly sent over the
              connection.  This matching-data compression comes at a cost of CPU, though, and can be disabled by repeating the --zz option,  but  only  if
              both sides are at least version 3.1.1.

              Note  that  if  your version of rsync was compiled with an external zlib (instead of the zlib that comes packaged with rsync) then it will
              not support the old-style compression, only the new-style (repeated-option) compression.  In the future this  new-style  compression  will
              likely become the default.

              The  client  rsync requests new-style compression on the server via the ----nneeww--ccoommpprreessss option, so if you see that option rejected it means
              that the server is not new enough to support --zzzz.  Rsync also accepts the ----oolldd--ccoommpprreessss option for a future time when new-style  compres‐
              sion becomes the default.

              See the ----sskkiipp--ccoommpprreessss option for the default list of file suffixes that will not be compressed.

       ----ccoommpprreessss--lleevveell==NNUUMM
              Explicitly  set the compression level to use (see ----ccoommpprreessss) instead of letting it default.  If NUM is non-zero, the ----ccoommpprreessss option is
              implied.

       ----sskkiipp--ccoommpprreessss==LLIISSTT
              Override the list of file suffixes that will not be compressed.  The LLIISSTT should be one or more file suffixes (without the dot)  separated
              by slashes (/).

              You may specify an empty string to indicate that no file should be skipped.

              Simple  character-class matching is supported: each must consist of a list of letters inside the square brackets (e.g. no special classes,
              such as "[:alpha:]", are supported, and ’-’ has no special meaning).

              The characters asterisk (*) and question-mark (?) have no special meaning.

              Here’s an example that specifies 6 suffixes to skip (since 1 of the 5 rules matches 2 suffixes):

                  --skip-compress=gz/jpg/mp[34]/7z/bz2

              The default list of suffixes that will not be compressed is this (in this version of rsync):

              77zz aaccee aavvii bbzz22 ddeebb ggppgg ggzz iissoo jjppeegg jjppgg llzz llzzmmaa llzzoo mmoovv mmpp33 mmpp44 oogggg ppnngg rraarr rrppmm rrzziipp ttbbzz ttggzz ttllzz ttxxzz xxzz zz zziipp

              This list will be replaced by your ----sskkiipp--ccoommpprreessss list in all but one situation: a copy from a daemon rsync will add  your  skipped  suf‐
              fixes to its list of non-compressing files (and its list may be configured to a different default).

       ----nnuummeerriicc--iiddss
              With this option rsync will transfer numeric group and user IDs rather than using user and group names and mapping them at both ends.

              By  default rsync will use the username and groupname to determine what ownership to give files. The special uid 0 and the special group 0
              are never mapped via user/group names even if the ----nnuummeerriicc--iiddss option is not specified.

              If a user or group has no name on the source system or it has no match on the destination system, then the numeric ID from the source sys‐
              tem  is used instead.  See also the comments on the "use chroot" setting in the rsyncd.conf manpage for information on how the chroot set‐
              ting affects rsync’s ability to look up the names of the users and groups and what you can do about it.

       ----uusseerrmmaapp==SSTTRRIINNGG,, ----ggrroouuppmmaapp==SSTTRRIINNGG
              These options allow you to specify users and groups that should be mapped to other values by the receiving side.  The  SSTTRRIINNGG  is  one  or
              more  FFRROOMM:TTOO pairs of values separated by commas.  Any matching FFRROOMM value from the sender is replaced with a TTOO value from the receiver.
              You may specify usernames or user IDs for the FFRROOMM and TTOO values, and the FFRROOMM value may also be a wild-card string, which will be matched
              against  the  sender’s  names  (wild-cards  do  NOT match against ID numbers, though see below for why a ’*’ matches everything).  You may
              instead specify a range of ID numbers via an inclusive range: LOW-HIGH.  For example:

                --usermap=0-99:nobody,wayne:admin,*:normal --groupmap=usr:1,1:usr

              The first match in the list is the one that is used.  You should specify all your user mappings using a single  ----uusseerrmmaapp  option,  and/or
              all your group mappings using a single ----ggrroouuppmmaapp option.

              Note  that the sender’s name for the 0 user and group are not transmitted to the receiver, so you should either match these values using a
              0, or use the names in effect on the receiving side (typically "root").  All other FFRROOMM names match those in use on the sending side.  All
              TTOO names match those in use on the receiving side.

              Any  IDs that do not have a name on the sending side are treated as having an empty name for the purpose of matching.  This allows them to
              be matched via a "*" or using an empty name.  For instance:

                --usermap=:nobody --groupmap=*:nobody

              When the ----nnuummeerriicc--iiddss option is used, the sender does not send any names, so all the IDs are treated as having an empty name.  This means
              that you will need to specify numeric FFRROOMM values if you want to map these nameless IDs to different values.

              For  the  ----uusseerrmmaapp option to have any effect, the --oo (----oowwnneerr) option must be used (or implied), and the receiver will need to be running
              as a super-user (see also the ----ffaakkee--ssuuppeerr option).  For the ----ggrroouuppmmaapp option to have any effect, the --gg (----ggrroouuppss) option must  be  used
              (or implied), and the receiver will need to have permissions to set that group.

       ----cchhoowwnn==UUSSEERR::GGRROOUUPP
              This  option  forces  all  files  to  be  owned by USER with group GROUP.  This is a simpler interface than using ----uusseerrmmaapp and ----ggrroouuppmmaapp
              directly, but it is implemented using those options internally, so you cannot mix them.  If either the USER or GROUP is empty, no  mapping
              for  the  omitted user/group will occur.  If GROUP is empty, the trailing colon may be omitted, but if USER is empty, a leading colon must
              be supplied.

              If you specify "--chown=foo:bar, this is exactly the same as specifying "--usermap=*:foo --groupmap=*:bar", only easier.

       ----ttiimmeeoouutt==TTIIMMEEOOUUTT
              This option allows you to set a maximum I/O timeout in seconds. If no data is transferred for the specified time then rsync will exit. The
              default is 0, which means no timeout.

       ----ccoonnttiimmeeoouutt
              This option allows you to set the amount of time that rsync will wait for its connection to an rsync daemon to succeed.  If the timeout is
              reached, rsync exits with an error.

       ----aaddddrreessss
              By default rsync will bind to the wildcard address when connecting to an rsync daemon.  The ----aaddddrreessss option allows you to specify a  spe‐
              cific IP address (or hostname) to bind to.  See also this option in the ----ddaaeemmoonn mode section.

       ----ppoorrtt==PPOORRTT
              This  specifies an alternate TCP port number to use rather than the default of 873.  This is only needed if you are using the double-colon
              (::) syntax to connect with an rsync daemon (since the URL syntax has a way to specify the port as a part of  the  URL).   See  also  this
              option in the ----ddaaeemmoonn mode section.

       ----ssoocckkooppttss
              This  option  can  provide  endless  fun  for  people who like to tune their systems to the utmost degree. You can set all sorts of socket
              options which may make transfers faster (or slower!). Read the man page for the setsockopt() system  call  for  details  on  some  of  the
              options  you  may  be  able  to set. By default no special socket options are set. This only affects direct socket connections to a remote
              rsync daemon.  This option also exists in the ----ddaaeemmoonn mode section.

       ----bblloocckkiinngg--iioo
              This tells rsync to use blocking I/O when launching a remote shell transport.  If the remote shell is either rsh or remsh, rsync  defaults
              to using blocking I/O, otherwise it defaults to using non-blocking I/O.  (Note that ssh prefers non-blocking I/O.)

       ----oouuttbbuuff==MMOODDEE
              This  sets  the  output buffering mode.  The mode can be None (aka Unbuffered), Line, or Block (aka Full).  You may specify as little as a
              single letter for the mode, and use upper or lower case.

              The main use of this option is to change Full buffering to Line buffering when rsync’s output is going to a file or pipe.

       --ii,, ----iitteemmiizzee--cchhaannggeess
              Requests a simple itemized list of the changes that are being made to each file, including attribute changes.  This is exactly the same as
              specifying  ----oouutt--ffoorrmmaatt==''%%ii  %%nn%%LL''.  If you repeat the option, unchanged files will also be output, but only if the receiving rsync is at
              least version 2.6.7 (you can use --vvvv with older versions of rsync, but that also turns on the output of other verbose messages).

              The "%i" escape has a cryptic output that is 11 letters long.  The general format is like the string YYXXccssttppoogguuaaxx, where YY is  replaced  by
              the  type  of update being done, XX is replaced by the file-type, and the other letters represent attributes that may be output if they are
              being modified.

              The update types that replace the YY are as follows:

              o      A << means that a file is being transferred to the remote host (sent).

              o      A >> means that a file is being transferred to the local host (received).

              o      A cc means that a local change/creation is occurring for the item (such as the creation of a directory or the changing of a symlink,
                     etc.).

              o      A hh means that the item is a hard link to another item (requires ----hhaarrdd--lliinnkkss).

              o      A .. means that the item is not being updated (though it might have attributes that are being modified).

              o      A ** means that the rest of the itemized-output area contains a message (e.g. "deleting").

              The file-types that replace the XX are: ff for a file, a dd for a directory, an LL for a symlink, a DD for a device, and a SS for a special file
              (e.g. named sockets and fifos).

              The other letters in the string above are the actual letters that will be output if the associated attribute for the item is being updated
              or  a  "."  for  no change.  Three exceptions to this are: (1) a newly created item replaces each letter with a "+", (2) an identical item
              replaces the dots with spaces, and (3) an unknown attribute replaces each letter with a "?" (this can happen  when  talking  to  an  older
              rsync).

              The attribute that is associated with each letter is as follows:

              o      A  cc means either that a regular file has a different checksum (requires ----cchheecckkssuumm) or that a symlink, device, or special file has
                     a changed value.  Note that if you are sending files to an rsync prior to 3.0.1, this change flag will be present only  for  check‐
                     sum-differing regular files.

              o      A ss means the size of a regular file is different and will be updated by the file transfer.

              o      A  tt means the modification time is different and is being updated to the sender’s value (requires ----ttiimmeess).  An alternate value of
                     TT means that the modification time will be set to the transfer time, which happens when a file/symlink/device  is  updated  without
                     ----ttiimmeess  and when a symlink is changed and the receiver can’t set its time.  (Note: when using an rsync 3.0.0 client, you might see
                     the ss flag combined with tt instead of the proper TT flag for this time-setting failure.)

              o      A pp means the permissions are different and are being updated to the sender’s value (requires ----ppeerrmmss).

              o      An oo means the owner is different and is being updated to the sender’s value (requires ----oowwnneerr and super-user privileges).

              o      A gg means the group is different and is being updated to the sender’s value (requires ----ggrroouupp and the authority to set the group).

              o      The uu slot is reserved for future use.

              o      The aa means that the ACL information changed.

              o      The xx means that the extended attribute information changed.

              One other output is possible:  when deleting files, the "%i" will output the string "*deleting"  for  each  item  that  is  being  removed
              (assuming that you are talking to a recent enough rsync that it logs deletions instead of outputting them as a verbose message).

       ----oouutt--ffoorrmmaatt==FFOORRMMAATT
              This  allows you to specify exactly what the rsync client outputs to the user on a per-update basis.  The format is a text string contain‐
              ing embedded single-character escape sequences prefixed with a percent (%) character.   A default format of "%n%L" is  assumed  if  either
              ----iinnffoo==nnaammee or --vv is specified (this tells you just the name of the file and, if the item is a link, where it points).  For a full list of
              the possible escape characters, see the "log format" setting in the rsyncd.conf manpage.

              Specifying the ----oouutt--ffoorrmmaatt option implies the ----iinnffoo==nnaammee option, which will mention each file, dir, etc. that gets updated in a signifi‐
              cant  way  (a  transferred  file, a recreated symlink/device, or a touched directory).  In addition, if the itemize-changes escape (%i) is
              included in the string (e.g. if the ----iitteemmiizzee--cchhaannggeess option was used), the logging of names increases to mention any item that is changed
              in any way (as long as the receiving side is at least 2.6.4).  See the ----iitteemmiizzee--cchhaannggeess option for a description of the output of "%i".

              Rsync  will  output  the  out-format string prior to a file’s transfer unless one of the transfer-statistic escapes is requested, in which
              case the logging is done at the end of the file’s transfer.  When this late logging is in effect and ----pprrooggrreessss is also  specified,  rsync
              will also output the name of the file being transferred prior to its progress information (followed, of course, by the out-format output).

       ----lloogg--ffiillee==FFIILLEE
              This  option  causes rsync to log what it is doing to a file.  This is similar to the logging that a daemon does, but can be requested for
              the client side and/or the server side of a non-daemon transfer.  If specified as a client option, transfer logging will be enabled with a
              default format of "%i %n%L".  See the ----lloogg--ffiillee--ffoorrmmaatt option if you wish to override this.

              Here’s a example command that requests the remote side to log what is happening:

                rsync -av --remote-option=--log-file=/tmp/rlog src/ dest/

              This is very useful if you need to debug why a connection is closing unexpectedly.

       ----lloogg--ffiillee--ffoorrmmaatt==FFOORRMMAATT
              This  allows  you  to  specify exactly what per-update logging is put into the file specified by the ----lloogg--ffiillee option (which must also be
              specified for this option to have any effect).  If you specify an empty string, updated files will not be mentioned in the log file.   For
              a list of the possible escape characters, see the "log format" setting in the rsyncd.conf manpage.

              The default FORMAT used if ----lloogg--ffiillee is specified and this option is not is ’%i %n%L’.

       ----ssttaattss
              This  tells  rsync  to  print  a verbose set of statistics on the file transfer, allowing you to tell how effective rsync’s delta-transfer
              algorithm is for your data.  This option is equivalent to ----iinnffoo==ssttaattss22 if combined with 0 or 1 --vv options, or ----iinnffoo==ssttaattss33  if  combined
              with 2 or more --vv options.

              The current statistics are as follows:

              o      NNuummbbeerr  ooff  ffiilleess  is  the count of all "files" (in the generic sense), which includes directories, symlinks, etc.  The total count
                     will be followed by a list of counts by filetype (if the total is non-zero).  For example: "(reg: 5, dir: 3, link: 2, dev: 1,  spe‐
                     cial:  1)" lists the totals for regular files, directories, symlinks, devices, and special files.  If any of value is 0, it is com‐
                     pletely omitted from the list.

              o      NNuummbbeerr ooff ccrreeaatteedd ffiilleess is the count of how many "files" (generic sense) were created (as opposed to  updated).   The  total  count
                     will be followed by a list of counts by filetype (if the total is non-zero).

              o      NNuummbbeerr  ooff  ddeelleetteedd  ffiilleess  is the count of how many "files" (generic sense) were created (as opposed to updated).  The total count
                     will be followed by a list of counts by filetype (if the total is non-zero).  Note that this line is only output if  deletions  are
                     in effect, and only if protocol 31 is being used (the default for rsync 3.1.x).

              o      NNuummbbeerr ooff rreegguullaarr ffiilleess ttrraannssffeerrrreedd is the count of normal files that were updated via rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm, which does
                     not include dirs, symlinks, etc.  Note that rsync 3.1.0 added the word "regular" into this heading.

              o      TToottaall ffiillee ssiizzee is the total sum of all file sizes in the transfer.  This does not count any size for directories or special files,
                     but does include the size of symlinks.

              o      TToottaall ttrraannssffeerrrreedd ffiillee ssiizzee is the total sum of all files sizes for just the transferred files.

              o      LLiitteerraall ddaattaa is how much unmatched file-update data we had to send to the receiver for it to recreate the updated files.

              o      MMaattcchheedd ddaattaa is how much data the receiver got locally when recreating the updated files.

              o      FFiillee  lliisstt ssiizzee is how big the file-list data was when the sender sent it to the receiver.  This is smaller than the in-memory size
                     for the file list due to some compressing of duplicated data when rsync sends the list.

              o      FFiillee lliisstt ggeenneerraattiioonn ttiimmee is the number of seconds that the sender spent creating the file list.  This requires a modern  rsync  on
                     the sending side for this to be present.

              o      FFiillee lliisstt ttrraannssffeerr ttiimmee is the number of seconds that the sender spent sending the file list to the receiver.

              o      TToottaall bbyytteess sseenntt is the count of all the bytes that rsync sent from the client side to the server side.

              o      TToottaall  bbyytteess rreecceeiivveedd is the count of all non-message bytes that rsync received by the client side from the server side.  "Non-mes‐
                     sage" bytes means that we don’t count the bytes for a verbose message that the server sent to us, which makes the stats  more  con‐
                     sistent.

       --88,, ----88--bbiitt--oouuttppuutt
              This  tells  rsync  to leave all high-bit characters unescaped in the output instead of trying to test them to see if they’re valid in the
              current locale and escaping the invalid ones.  All control characters (but never tabs) are always escaped,  regardless  of  this  option’s
              setting.

              The escape idiom that started in 2.6.7 is to output a literal backslash (\) and a hash (#), followed by exactly 3 octal digits.  For exam‐
              ple, a newline would output as "\#012".  A literal backslash that is in a filename is not escaped unless it is followed by a  hash  and  3
              digits (0-9).

       --hh,, ----hhuummaann--rreeaaddaabbllee
              Output  numbers  in a more human-readable format.  There are 3 possible levels:  (1) output numbers with a separator between each set of 3
              digits (either a comma or a period, depending on if the decimal point is represented by a period or a comma); (2) output numbers in  units
              of 1000 (with a character suffix for larger units -- see below); (3) output numbers in units of 1024.

              The default is human-readable level 1.  Each --hh option increases the level by one.  You can take the level down to 0 (to output numbers as
              pure digits) by specifing the ----nnoo--hhuummaann--rreeaaddaabbllee (----nnoo--hh) option.

              The unit letters that are appended in levels 2 and 3 are: K (kilo), M (mega), G (giga), or T (tera).  For  example,  a  1234567-byte  file
              would output as 1.23M in level-2 (assuming that a period is your local decimal point).

              Backward  compatibility note:  versions of rsync prior to 3.1.0 do not support human-readable level 1, and they default to level 0.  Thus,
              specifying one or two --hh options will behave in a comparable manner in old and new versions as long as you didn’t specify a ----nnoo--hh  option
              prior to one or more --hh options.  See the ----lliisstt--oonnllyy option for one difference.

       ----ppaarrttiiaall
              By default, rsync will delete any partially transferred file if the transfer is interrupted. In some circumstances it is more desirable to
              keep partially transferred files. Using the ----ppaarrttiiaall option tells rsync to keep the partial file which should make a subsequent  transfer
              of the rest of the file much faster.

       ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr==DDIIRR
              A  better  way  to keep partial files than the ----ppaarrttiiaall option is to specify a _D_I_R that will be used to hold the partial data (instead of
              writing it out to the destination file).  On the next transfer, rsync will use a file found in this dir as data to speed up the resumption
              of the transfer and then delete it after it has served its purpose.

              Note  that  if  ----wwhhoollee--ffiillee is specified (or implied), any partial-dir file that is found for a file that is being updated will simply be
              removed (since rsync is sending files without using rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm).

              Rsync will create the _D_I_R if it is missing (just the last dir -- not the whole path).  This makes it easy to use a relative path (such  as
              "----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr==..rrssyynncc--ppaarrttiiaall")  to  have  rsync  create  the  partial-directory in the destination file’s directory when needed, and then
              remove it again when the partial file is deleted.

              If the partial-dir value is not an absolute path, rsync will add an exclude rule at the end of all your existing excludes.  This will pre‐
              vent  the  sending of any partial-dir files that may exist on the sending side, and will also prevent the untimely deletion of partial-dir
              items on the receiving side.  An example: the above ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr option would add the equivalent of "--ff ''--pp ..rrssyynncc--ppaarrttiiaall//''" at the  end
              of any other filter rules.

              If  you  are  supplying your own exclude rules, you may need to add your own exclude/hide/protect rule for the partial-dir because (1) the
              auto-added rule may be ineffective at the end of your other rules, or (2) you may wish to override rsync’s exclude choice.  For  instance,
              if you want to make rsync clean-up any left-over partial-dirs that may be lying around, you should specify ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr and add a "risk"
              filter rule, e.g.  --ff ''RR ..rrssyynncc--ppaarrttiiaall//''.  (Avoid using ----ddeelleettee--bbeeffoorree or ----ddeelleettee--dduurriinngg unless you don’t need rsync to use any of  the
              left-over partial-dir data during the current run.)

              IMPORTANT: the ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr should not be writable by other users or it is a security risk.  E.g. AVOID "/tmp".

              You  can also set the partial-dir value the RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR environment variable.  Setting this in the environment does not force ----ppaarr‐‐
              ttiiaall to be enabled, but rather it affects where partial files go when ----ppaarrttiiaall is specified.   For  instance,  instead  of  using  ----ppaarr‐‐
              ttiiaall--ddiirr==..rrssyynncc--ttmmpp  along with ----pprrooggrreessss, you could set RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR=.rsync-tmp in your environment and then just use the --PP option
              to turn on the use of the .rsync-tmp dir for partial transfers.  The only times that the ----ppaarrttiiaall option does not look for this  environ‐
              ment value are (1) when ----iinnppllaaccee was specified (since ----iinnppllaaccee conflicts with ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr), and (2) when ----ddeellaayy--uuppddaatteess was specified
              (see below).

              For the purposes of the daemon-config’s "refuse options" setting, ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr does _n_o_t imply ----ppaarrttiiaall.  This is so that  a  refusal  of
              the  ----ppaarrttiiaall option can be used to disallow the overwriting of destination files with a partial transfer, while still allowing the safer
              idiom provided by ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr.

       ----ddeellaayy--uuppddaatteess
              This option puts the temporary file from each updated file into a holding directory until the end of the transfer, at which time  all  the
              files  are  renamed into place in rapid succession.  This attempts to make the updating of the files a little more atomic.  By default the
              files are placed into a directory named ".~tmp~" in each file’s destination directory, but if you’ve specified the  ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr  option,
              that  directory  will  be  used  instead.  See the comments in the ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr section for a discussion of how this ".~tmp~" dir will be
              excluded from the transfer, and what you can do if you want rsync to cleanup old ".~tmp~" dirs that might be lying around.  Conflicts with
              ----iinnppllaaccee and ----aappppeenndd.

              This  option uses more memory on the receiving side (one bit per file transferred) and also requires enough free disk space on the receiv‐
              ing side to hold an additional copy of all the updated files.  Note also that you should not use an absolute path to ----ppaarrttiiaall--ddiirr  unless
              (1)  there  is  no  chance of any of the files in the transfer having the same name (since all the updated files will be put into a single
              directory if the path is absolute) and (2) there are no mount points in the hierarchy (since the delayed updates will fail if  they  can’t
              be renamed into place).

              See  also the "atomic-rsync" perl script in the "support" subdir for an update algorithm that is even more atomic (it uses ----lliinnkk--ddeesstt and
              a parallel hierarchy of files).

       --mm,, ----pprruunnee--eemmppttyy--ddiirrss
              This option tells the receiving rsync to get rid of empty directories from the  file-list,  including  nested  directories  that  have  no
              non-directory  children.  This is useful for avoiding the creation of a bunch of useless directories when the sending rsync is recursively
              scanning a hierarchy of files using include/exclude/filter rules.

              Note that the use of transfer rules, such as the ----mmiinn--ssiizzee option, does not affect what goes into the file list, and thus does not  leave
              directories empty, even if none of the files in a directory match the transfer rule.

              Because  the  file-list is actually being pruned, this option also affects what directories get deleted when a delete is active.  However,
              keep in mind that excluded files and directories can prevent existing items from being deleted due to an exclude both hiding source  files
              and protecting destination files.  See the perishable filter-rule option for how to avoid this.

              You can prevent the pruning of certain empty directories from the file-list by using a global "protect" filter.  For instance, this option
              would ensure that the directory "emptydir" was kept in the file-list:

              --filter ’protect emptydir/’

              Here’s an example that copies all .pdf files in a hierarchy, only creating the necessary destination directories to hold the  .pdf  files,
              and  ensures that any superfluous files and directories in the destination are removed (note the hide filter of non-directories being used
              instead of an exclude):

              rsync -avm --del --include=’*.pdf’ -f ’hide,! */’ src/ dest

              If you didn’t want to remove superfluous destination files, the more time-honored options of  "----iinncclluuddee==''**//''  ----eexxcclluuddee==''**''"  would  work
              fine in place of the hide-filter (if that is more natural to you).

       ----pprrooggrreessss
              This  option  tells  rsync  to print information showing the progress of the transfer. This gives a bored user something to watch.  With a
              modern rsync this is the same as specifying ----iinnffoo==fflliisstt22,,nnaammee,,pprrooggrreessss, but any user-supplied settings for those info flags takes  prece‐
              dence (e.g. "--info=flist0 --progress").

              While rsync is transferring a regular file, it updates a progress line that looks like this:

                    782448  63%  110.64kB/s    0:00:04

              In this example, the receiver has reconstructed 782448 bytes or 63% of the sender’s file, which is being reconstructed at a rate of 110.64
              kilobytes per second, and the transfer will finish in 4 seconds if the current rate is maintained until the end.

              These statistics can be misleading if rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm is in use.  For example, if the sender’s file consists of the basis
              file  followed  by  additional data, the reported rate will probably drop dramatically when the receiver gets to the literal data, and the
              transfer will probably take much longer to finish than the receiver estimated as it was finishing the matched part of the file.

              When the file transfer finishes, rsync replaces the progress line with a summary line that looks like this:

                    1,238,099 100%  146.38kB/s    0:00:08  (xfr#5, to-chk=169/396)

              In this example, the file was 1,238,099 bytes long in total, the average rate of transfer for the whole file was 146.38 kilobytes per sec‐
              ond over the 8 seconds that it took to complete, it was the 5th transfer of a regular file during the current rsync session, and there are
              169 more files for the receiver to check (to see if they are up-to-date or not) remaining out of the 396 total files in the file-list.

              In an incremental recursion scan, rsync won’t know the total number of files in the file-list until it reaches the ends of the  scan,  but
              since it starts to transfer files during the scan, it will display a line with the text "ir-chk" (for incremental recursion check) instead
              of "to-chk" until the point that it knows the full size of the list, at which point it  will  switch  to  using  "to-chk".   Thus,  seeing
              "ir-chk"  lets  you  know  that  the total count of files in the file list is still going to increase (and each time it does, the count of
              files left to check  will increase by the number of the files added to the list).

       --PP     The --PP option is equivalent to ----ppaarrttiiaall ----pprrooggrreessss.  Its purpose is to make it much easier to specify these two options for a long trans‐
              fer that may be interrupted.

              There  is also a ----iinnffoo==pprrooggrreessss22 option that outputs statistics based on the whole transfer, rather than individual files.  Use this flag
              without outputting a filename (e.g. avoid --vv or specify ----iinnffoo==nnaammee00) if you want to see how the transfer is doing without  scrolling  the
              screen with a lot of names.  (You don’t need to specify the ----pprrooggrreessss option in order to use ----iinnffoo==pprrooggrreessss22.)

       ----ppaasssswwoorrdd--ffiillee==FFIILLEE
              This option allows you to provide a password for accessing an rsync daemon via a file or via standard input if FFIILLEE is --.  The file should
              contain just the password on the first line (all other lines are ignored).  Rsync will exit with an error if FFIILLEE is world readable or  if
              a root-run rsync command finds a non-root-owned file.

              This  option does not supply a password to a remote shell transport such as ssh; to learn how to do that, consult the remote shell’s docu‐
              mentation.  When accessing an rsync daemon using a remote shell as the transport, this option only comes  into  effect  after  the  remote
              shell finishes its authentication (i.e. if you have also specified a password in the daemon’s config file).

       ----lliisstt--oonnllyy
              This  option will cause the source files to be listed instead of transferred.  This option is inferred if there is a single source arg and
              no destination specified, so its main uses are: (1) to turn a copy command that includes a destination arg into a file-listing command, or
              (2)  to  be  able to specify more than one source arg (note: be sure to include the destination).  Caution: keep in mind that a source arg
              with a wild-card is expanded by the shell into multiple args, so it is never safe to try to list such an arg without  using  this  option.
              For example:

                  rsync -av --list-only foo* dest/

              Starting  with  rsync  3.1.0,  the  sizes output by ----lliisstt--oonnllyy are affected by the ----hhuummaann--rreeaaddaabbllee option.  By default they will contain
              digit separators, but higher levels of readability will output the sizes with unit suffixes.  Note also that the column width for the size
              output has increased from 11 to 14 characters for all human-readable levels.  Use ----nnoo--hh if you want just digits in the sizes, and the old
              column width of 11 characters.

              Compatibility note:  when requesting a remote listing of files from an rsync that is version 2.6.3 or older, you may encounter an error if
              you  ask  for  a  non-recursive listing.  This is because a file listing implies the ----ddiirrss option w/o ----rreeccuurrssiivvee, and older rsyncs don’t
              have that option.  To avoid this problem, either specify the ----nnoo--ddiirrss option (if you don’t need to expand a directory’s content), or turn
              on recursion and exclude the content of subdirectories: --rr ----eexxcclluuddee==''//**//**''.

       ----bbwwlliimmiitt==RRAATTEE
              This  option  allows  you to specify the maximum transfer rate for the data sent over the socket, specified in units per second.  The RATE
              value can be suffixed with a string to indicate a size multiplier, and may be a fractional value (e.g.  "----bbwwlliimmiitt==11..55mm").  If  no  suffix
              is  specified,  the  value will be assumed to be in units of 1024 bytes (as if "K" or "KiB" had been appended).  See the ----mmaaxx--ssiizzee option
              for a description of all the available suffixes. A value of zero specifies no limit.

              For backward-compatibility reasons, the rate limit will be rounded to the nearest KiB unit, so no rate smaller than 1024 bytes per  second
              is possible.

              Rsync  writes  data over the socket in blocks, and this option both limits the size of the blocks that rsync writes, and tries to keep the
              average transfer rate at the requested limit.  Some "burstiness" may be seen where rsync writes out a block of data  and  then  sleeps  to
              bring the average rate into compliance.

              Due  to  the internal buffering of data, the ----pprrooggrreessss option may not be an accurate reflection on how fast the data is being sent.  This
              is because some files can show up as being rapidly sent when the data is quickly buffered, while other can show up as very slow  when  the
              flushing of the output buffer occurs.  This may be fixed in a future version.

       ----wwrriittee--bbaattcchh==FFIILLEE
              Record  a file that can later be applied to another identical destination with ----rreeaadd--bbaattcchh. See the "BATCH MODE" section for details, and
              also the ----oonnllyy--wwrriittee--bbaattcchh option.

       ----oonnllyy--wwrriittee--bbaattcchh==FFIILLEE
              Works like ----wwrriittee--bbaattcchh, except that no updates are made on the destination system when creating the batch.  This lets you transport  the
              changes to the destination system via some other means and then apply the changes via ----rreeaadd--bbaattcchh.

              Note  that  you  can  feel  free to write the batch directly to some portable media: if this media fills to capacity before the end of the
              transfer, you can just apply that partial transfer to the destination and repeat the whole process to get the rest of the changes (as long
              as you don’t mind a partially updated destination system while the multi-update cycle is happening).

              Also  note  that  you only save bandwidth when pushing changes to a remote system because this allows the batched data to be diverted from
              the sender into the batch file without having to flow over the wire to the receiver (when pulling, the sender is remote,  and  thus  can’t
              write the batch).

       ----rreeaadd--bbaattcchh==FFIILLEE
              Apply  all  of  the  changes stored in FILE, a file previously generated by ----wwrriittee--bbaattcchh.  If _F_I_L_E is --, the batch data will be read from
              standard input.  See the "BATCH MODE" section for details.

       ----pprroottooccooll==NNUUMM
              Force an older protocol version to be used.  This is useful for creating a batch file that is compatible with an older version  of  rsync.
              For  instance,  if  rsync  2.6.4 is being used with the ----wwrriittee--bbaattcchh option, but rsync 2.6.3 is what will be used to run the ----rreeaadd--bbaattcchh
              option, you should use "--protocol=28" when creating the batch file to force the older protocol version to  be  used  in  the  batch  file
              (assuming you can’t upgrade the rsync on the reading system).

       ----iiccoonnvv==CCOONNVVEERRTT__SSPPEECC
              Rsync  can  convert  filenames  between  character sets using this option.  Using a CONVERT_SPEC of "." tells rsync to look up the default
              character-set via the locale setting.  Alternately, you can fully specify what conversion to do by giving a local  and  a  remote  charset
              separated  by  a  comma  in the order ----iiccoonnvv==LLOOCCAALL,,RREEMMOOTTEE, e.g.  ----iiccoonnvv==uuttff88,,iissoo8888559911.  This order ensures that the option will stay the
              same whether you’re pushing or pulling files.  Finally, you can specify either ----nnoo--iiccoonnvv or a CONVERT_SPEC of "-" to turn off any conver‐
              sion.  The default setting of this option is site-specific, and can also be affected via the RSYNC_ICONV environment variable.

              For a list of what charset names your local iconv library supports, you can run "iconv --list".

              If  you  specify the ----pprrootteecctt--aarrggss option (--ss), rsync will translate the filenames you specify on the command-line that are being sent to
              the remote host.  See also the ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm option.

              Note that rsync does not do any conversion of names in filter files (including include/exclude files).  It is up to  you  to  ensure  that
              you’re  specifying matching rules that can match on both sides of the transfer.  For instance, you can specify extra include/exclude rules
              if there are filename differences on the two sides that need to be accounted for.

              When you pass an ----iiccoonnvv option to an rsync daemon that allows it, the daemon uses the charset specified in  its  "charset"  configuration
              parameter  regardless  of  the  remote  charset you actually pass.  Thus, you may feel free to specify just the local charset for a daemon
              transfer (e.g. ----iiccoonnvv==uuttff88).

       --44,, ----iippvv44 or --66,, ----iippvv66
              Tells rsync to prefer IPv4/IPv6 when creating sockets.  This only affects sockets that rsync has direct control over, such as the outgoing
              socket when directly contacting an rsync daemon.  See also these options in the ----ddaaeemmoonn mode section.

              If  rsync was complied without support for IPv6, the ----iippvv66 option will have no effect.  The ----vveerrssiioonn output will tell you if this is the
              case.

       ----cchheecckkssuumm--sseeeedd==NNUUMM
              Set the checksum seed to the integer NUM.  This 4 byte checksum seed is included in each block and MD4 file checksum calculation (the more
              modern MD5 file checksums don’t use a seed).  By default the checksum seed is generated by the server and defaults to the current time() .
              This option is used to set a specific checksum seed, which is useful for applications that want repeatable block checksums, or in the case
              where the user wants a more random checksum seed.  Setting NUM to 0 causes rsync to use the default of time() for checksum seed.

DDAAEEMMOONN OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The options allowed when starting an rsync daemon are as follows:

       ----ddaaeemmoonn
              This tells rsync that it is to run as a daemon.  The daemon you start running may be accessed using an rsync client using the hhoosstt::::mmoodduullee
              or rrssyynncc::////hhoosstt//mmoodduullee// syntax.

              If standard input is a socket then rsync will assume that it is being run via inetd, otherwise it will detach from  the  current  terminal
              and  become  a  background  daemon.   The  daemon  will read the config file (rsyncd.conf) on each connect made by a client and respond to
              requests accordingly.  See the rrssyynnccdd..ccoonnff(5) man page for more details.

       ----aaddddrreessss
              By default rsync will bind to the wildcard address when run as a daemon with the ----ddaaeemmoonn option.  The  ----aaddddrreessss  option  allows  you  to
              specify a specific IP address (or hostname) to bind to.  This makes virtual hosting possible in conjunction with the ----ccoonnffiigg option.  See
              also the "address" global option in the rsyncd.conf manpage.

       ----bbwwlliimmiitt==RRAATTEE
              This option allows you to specify the maximum transfer rate for the data the daemon sends over the socket.  The client can still specify a
              smaller ----bbwwlliimmiitt value, but no larger value will be allowed.  See the client version of this option (above) for some extra details.

       ----ccoonnffiigg==FFIILLEE
              This  specifies  an  alternate  config  file  than  the  default.   This  is  only  relevant  when  ----ddaaeemmoonn is specified.  The default is
              /etc/rsyncd.conf unless the daemon is running over a remote shell program and the remote user is not the  super-user;  in  that  case  the
              default is rsyncd.conf in the current directory (typically $HOME).

       --MM,, ----ddppaarraamm==OOVVEERRRRIIDDEE
              This  option can be used to set a daemon-config parameter when starting up rsync in daemon mode.  It is equivalent to adding the parameter
              at the end of the global settings prior to the first module’s definition.  The parameter names can be specified without spaces, if you  so
              desire.  For instance:

                  rsync --daemon -M pidfile=/path/rsync.pid

       ----nnoo--ddeettaacchh
              When  running as a daemon, this option instructs rsync to not detach itself and become a background process.  This option is required when
              running as a service on Cygwin, and may also be useful when rsync is supervised by a program such as ddaaeemmoonnttoooollss or AIX’s SSyysstteemm  RReessoouurrccee
              CCoonnttrroolllleerr.   ----nnoo--ddeettaacchh is also recommended when rsync is run under a debugger.  This option has no effect if rsync is run from inetd or
              sshd.

       ----ppoorrtt==PPOORRTT
              This specifies an alternate TCP port number for the daemon to listen on rather than the default of 873.  See also the "port" global option
              in the rsyncd.conf manpage.

       ----lloogg--ffiillee==FFIILLEE
              This option tells the rsync daemon to use the given log-file name instead of using the "log file" setting in the config file.

       ----lloogg--ffiillee--ffoorrmmaatt==FFOORRMMAATT
              This  option  tells the rsync daemon to use the given FORMAT string instead of using the "log format" setting in the config file.  It also
              enables "transfer logging" unless the string is empty, in which case transfer logging is turned off.

       ----ssoocckkooppttss
              This overrides the ssoocckkeett ooppttiioonnss setting in the rsyncd.conf file and has the same syntax.

       --vv,, ----vveerrbboossee
              This option increases the amount of information the daemon logs during its startup phase.  After the client connects,  the  daemon’s  ver‐
              bosity level will be controlled by the options that the client used and the "max verbosity" setting in the module’s config section.

       --44,, ----iippvv44 or --66,, ----iippvv66
              Tells rsync to prefer IPv4/IPv6 when creating the incoming sockets that the rsync daemon will use to listen for connections.  One of these
              options may be required in older versions of Linux to work around an IPv6 bug in the kernel (if you see an "address already in use"  error
              when nothing else is using the port, try specifying ----iippvv66 or ----iippvv44 when starting the daemon).

              If  rsync was complied without support for IPv6, the ----iippvv66 option will have no effect.  The ----vveerrssiioonn output will tell you if this is the
              case.

       --hh,, ----hheellpp
              When specified after ----ddaaeemmoonn, print a short help page describing the options available for starting an rsync daemon.

FFIILLTTEERR RRUULLEESS
       The filter rules allow for flexible selection of which files to transfer (include) and which files to skip (exclude).  The rules either  directly
       specify include/exclude patterns or they specify a way to acquire more include/exclude patterns (e.g. to read them from a file).

       As  the  list of files/directories to transfer is built, rsync checks each name to be transferred against the list of include/exclude patterns in
       turn, and the first matching pattern is acted on:  if it is an exclude pattern, then that file is skipped; if it is an include pattern then  that
       filename is not skipped; if no matching pattern is found, then the filename is not skipped.

       Rsync builds an ordered list of filter rules as specified on the command-line.  Filter rules have the following syntax:

              RULE [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]
              RULE,MODIFIERS [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]

       You  have  your  choice of using either short or long RULE names, as described below.  If you use a short-named rule, the ’,’ separating the RULE
       from the MODIFIERS is optional.  The PATTERN or FILENAME that follows (when present) must come after either a single space or an underscore  (_).
       Here are the available rule prefixes:

              eexxcclluuddee,, -- specifies an exclude pattern.
              iinncclluuddee,, ++ specifies an include pattern.
              mmeerrggee,, .. specifies a merge-file to read for more rules.
              ddiirr--mmeerrggee,, :: specifies a per-directory merge-file.
              hhiiddee,, HH specifies a pattern for hiding files from the transfer.
              sshhooww,, SS files that match the pattern are not hidden.
              pprrootteecctt,, PP specifies a pattern for protecting files from deletion.
              rriisskk,, RR files that match the pattern are not protected.
              cclleeaarr,, !! clears the current include/exclude list (takes no arg)

       When rules are being read from a file, empty lines are ignored, as are comment lines that start with a "#".

       Note  that  the  ----iinncclluuddee/----eexxcclluuddee  command-line  options do not allow the full range of rule parsing as described above -- they only allow the
       specification of include/exclude patterns plus a "!" token to clear the list (and the normal comment parsing when rules are read  from  a  file).
       If  a  pattern does not begin with "- " (dash, space) or "+ " (plus, space), then the rule will be interpreted as if "+ " (for an include option)
       or "- " (for an exclude option) were prefixed to the string.  A ----ffiilltteerr option, on the other hand, must always contain either a  short  or  long
       rule name at the start of the rule.

       Note also that the ----ffiilltteerr, ----iinncclluuddee, and ----eexxcclluuddee options take one rule/pattern each. To add multiple ones, you can repeat the options on the
       command-line, use the merge-file syntax of the ----ffiilltteerr option, or the ----iinncclluuddee--ffrroomm/----eexxcclluuddee--ffrroomm options.

       You can include and exclude files by specifying patterns using the "+", "-", etc. filter rules (as introduced in the FILTER RULES section above).
       The include/exclude rules each specify a pattern that is matched against the names of the files that are going to be transferred.  These patterns
       can take several forms:

       o      if the pattern starts with a / then it is anchored to a particular spot in the hierarchy of files, otherwise it is matched against the end
              of  the  pathname.  This is similar to a leading ^ in regular expressions.  Thus "/foo" would match a name of "foo" at either the "root of
              the transfer" (for a global rule) or in the merge-file’s directory (for a per-directory rule).  An unqualified "foo" would match a name of
              "foo"  anywhere  in  the  tree because the algorithm is applied recursively from the top down; it behaves as if each path component gets a
              turn at being the end of the filename.  Even the unanchored "sub/foo" would match at any point in the hierarchy where a  "foo"  was  found
              within  a  directory named "sub".  See the section on ANCHORING INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERNS for a full discussion of how to specify a pattern
              that matches at the root of the transfer.

       o      if the pattern ends with a / then it will only match a directory, not a regular file, symlink, or device.

       o      rsync chooses between doing a simple string match and wildcard matching by checking if the pattern contains one of  these  three  wildcard
              characters: ’*’, ’?’, and ’[’ .

       o      a ’*’ matches any path component, but it stops at slashes.

       o      use ’**’ to match anything, including slashes.

       o      a ’?’ matches any character except a slash (/).

       o      a ’[’ introduces a character class, such as [a-z] or [[:alpha:]].

       o      in  a wildcard pattern, a backslash can be used to escape a wildcard character, but it is matched literally when no wildcards are present.
              This means that there is an extra level of backslash removal when a pattern contains wildcard characters compared to a  pattern  that  has
              none.   e.g. if you add a wildcard to "foo\bar" (which matches the backslash) you would need to use "foo\\bar*" to avoid the "\b" becoming
              just "b".

       o      if the pattern contains a / (not counting a trailing /) or a "**", then it is matched against the full  pathname,  including  any  leading
              directories. If the pattern doesn’t contain a / or a "**", then it is matched only against the final component of the filename.  (Remember
              that the algorithm is applied recursively so "full filename" can actually be any portion of a path from the starting directory on down.)

       o      a trailing "dir_name/***" will match both the directory (as if "dir_name/" had been specified) and everything  in  the  directory  (as  if
              "dir_name/**" had been specified).  This behavior was added in version 2.6.7.

       Note  that,  when  using  the ----rreeccuurrssiivvee (--rr) option (which is implied by --aa), every subcomponent of every path is visited from the top down, so
       include/exclude patterns get applied recursively to each subcomponent’s full name (e.g. to include "/foo/bar/baz" the  subcomponents  "/foo"  and
       "/foo/bar"  must not be excluded).  The exclude patterns actually short-circuit the directory traversal stage when rsync finds the files to send.
       If a pattern excludes a particular parent directory, it can render a deeper include pattern ineffectual because rsync  did  not  descend  through
       that excluded section of the hierarchy.  This is particularly important when using a trailing ’*’ rule.  For instance, this won’t work:

              + /some/path/this-file-will-not-be-found
              + /file-is-included
              - *

       This  fails  because the parent directory "some" is excluded by the ’*’ rule, so rsync never visits any of the files in the "some" or "some/path"
       directories.  One solution is to ask for all directories in the hierarchy to be included by using a single rule: "+ */" (put it somewhere  before
       the  "-  *" rule), and perhaps use the ----pprruunnee--eemmppttyy--ddiirrss option.  Another solution is to add specific include rules for all the parent dirs that
       need to be visited.  For instance, this set of rules works fine:

              + /some/
              + /some/path/
              + /some/path/this-file-is-found
              + /file-also-included
              - *

       Here are some examples of exclude/include matching:

       o      "- *.o" would exclude all names matching *.o

       o      "- /foo" would exclude a file (or directory) named foo in the transfer-root directory

       o      "- foo/" would exclude any directory named foo

       o      "- /foo/*/bar" would exclude any file named bar which is at two levels below a directory named foo in the transfer-root directory

       o      "- /foo/**/bar" would exclude any file named bar two or more levels below a directory named foo in the transfer-root directory

       o      The combination of "+ */", "+ *.c", and "- *" would  include  all  directories  and  C  source  files  but  nothing  else  (see  also  the
              ----pprruunnee--eemmppttyy--ddiirrss option)

       o      The  combination  of  "+  foo/",  "+  foo/bar.c",  and "- *" would include only the foo directory and foo/bar.c (the foo directory must be
              explicitly included or it would be excluded by the "*")

       The following modifiers are accepted after a "+" or "-":

       o      A // specifies that the include/exclude rule should be matched against the absolute  pathname  of  the  current  item.   For  example,  "-/
              /etc/passwd"  would  exclude  the passwd file any time the transfer was sending files from the "/etc" directory, and "-/ subdir/foo" would
              always exclude "foo" when it is in a dir named "subdir", even if "foo" is at the root of the current transfer.

       o      A !! specifies that the include/exclude should take effect if the pattern fails  to  match.   For  instance,  "-!  */"  would  exclude  all
              non-directories.

       o      A CC is used to indicate that all the global CVS-exclude rules should be inserted as excludes in place of the "-C".  No arg should follow.

       o      An  ss  is  used to indicate that the rule applies to the sending side.  When a rule affects the sending side, it prevents files from being
              transferred.  The default is for a rule to affect both sides unless ----ddeelleettee--eexxcclluuddeedd was specified, in which case  default  rules  become
              sender-side only.  See also the hide (H) and show (S) rules, which are an alternate way to specify sending-side includes/excludes.

       o      An  rr  is  used  to  indicate that the rule applies to the receiving side.  When a rule affects the receiving side, it prevents files from
              being deleted.  See the ss modifier for more info.  See also the protect (P) and risk (R) rules, which are  an  alternate  way  to  specify
              receiver-side includes/excludes.

       o      A  pp indicates that a rule is perishable, meaning that it is ignored in directories that are being deleted.  For instance, the --CC option’s
              default rules that exclude things like "CVS" and "*.o" are marked as perishable, and will not prevent a directory that was removed on  the
              source from being deleted on the destination.

       You  can  merge  whole  files into your filter rules by specifying either a merge (.) or a dir-merge (:) filter rule (as introduced in the FILTER
       RULES section above).

       There are two kinds of merged files -- single-instance (’.’) and per-directory (’:’).  A single-instance merge file is read  one  time,  and  its
       rules are incorporated into the filter list in the place of the "." rule.  For per-directory merge files, rsync will scan every directory that it
       traverses for the named file, merging its contents when the file exists into the current list of inherited rules.  These per-directory rule files
       must  be  created on the sending side because it is the sending side that is being scanned for the available files to transfer.  These rule files
       may also need to be transferred to the receiving side if you want them to affect what files don’t get deleted (see PER-DIRECTORY RULES AND DELETE
       below).

       Some examples:

              merge /etc/rsync/default.rules
              . /etc/rsync/default.rules
              dir-merge .per-dir-filter
              dir-merge,n- .non-inherited-per-dir-excludes
              :n- .non-inherited-per-dir-excludes

       The following modifiers are accepted after a merge or dir-merge rule:

       o      A -- specifies that the file should consist of only exclude patterns, with no other rule-parsing except for in-file comments.

       o      A ++ specifies that the file should consist of only include patterns, with no other rule-parsing except for in-file comments.

       o      A  CC  is  a  way to specify that the file should be read in a CVS-compatible manner.  This turns on ’n’, ’w’, and ’-’, but also allows the
              list-clearing token (!) to be specified.  If no filename is provided, ".cvsignore" is assumed.

       o      A ee will exclude the merge-file name from the transfer; e.g.  "dir-merge,e .rules" is like "dir-merge .rules" and "- .rules".

       o      An nn specifies that the rules are not inherited by subdirectories.

       o      A ww specifies that the rules are word-split on whitespace instead of the normal line-splitting.  This also turns off comments.  Note:  the
              space  that separates the prefix from the rule is treated specially, so "- foo + bar" is parsed as two rules (assuming that prefix-parsing
              wasn’t also disabled).

       o      You may also specify any of the modifiers for the "+" or "-" rules (above) in order to have the rules that  are  read  in  from  the  file
              default  to  having  that modifier set (except for the !! modifier, which would not be useful).  For instance, "merge,-/ .excl" would treat
              the contents of .excl as absolute-path excludes, while "dir-merge,s .filt" and ":sC" would each make all their per-directory  rules  apply
              only  on the sending side.  If the merge rule specifies sides to affect (via the ss or rr modifier or both), then the rules in the file must
              not specify sides (via a modifier or a rule prefix such as hhiiddee).

       Per-directory rules are inherited in all subdirectories of the directory where the merge-file was found unless the ’n’ modifier was  used.   Each
       subdirectory’s  rules are prefixed to the inherited per-directory rules from its parents, which gives the newest rules a higher priority than the
       inherited rules.  The entire set of dir-merge rules are grouped together in the spot where the merge-file was specified, so  it  is  possible  to
       override  dir-merge  rules  via  a rule that got specified earlier in the list of global rules.  When the list-clearing rule ("!") is read from a
       per-directory file, it only clears the inherited rules for the current merge file.

       Another way to prevent a single rule from a dir-merge file from being inherited is to anchor it with  a  leading  slash.   Anchored  rules  in  a
       per-directory  merge-file  are relative to the merge-file’s directory, so a pattern "/foo" would only match the file "foo" in the directory where
       the dir-merge filter file was found.

       Here’s an example filter file which you’d specify via ----ffiilltteerr=="".. ffiillee""::

              merge /home/user/.global-filter
              - *.gz
              dir-merge .rules
              + *.[ch]
              - *.o

       This will merge the contents of the /home/user/.global-filter file at the start of  the  list  and  also  turns  the  ".rules"  filename  into  a
       per-directory  filter  file.   All rules read in prior to the start of the directory scan follow the global anchoring rules (i.e. a leading slash
       matches at the root of the transfer).

       If a per-directory merge-file is specified with a path that is a parent directory of the first transfer directory, rsync will scan all the parent
       dirs from that starting point to the transfer directory for the indicated per-directory file.  For instance, here is a common filter (see --FF):

              --filter=': /.rsync-filter'

       That rule tells rsync to scan for the file .rsync-filter in all directories from the root down through the parent directory of the transfer prior
       to the start of the normal directory scan of the file in the directories that are sent as a part of the transfer.  (Note: for  an  rsync  daemon,
       the root is always the same as the module’s "path".)

       Some examples of this pre-scanning for per-directory files:

              rsync -avF /src/path/ /dest/dir
              rsync -av --filter=': ../../.rsync-filter' /src/path/ /dest/dir
              rsync -av --filter=': .rsync-filter' /src/path/ /dest/dir

       The  first  two  commands above will look for ".rsync-filter" in "/" and "/src" before the normal scan begins looking for the file in "/src/path"
       and its subdirectories.  The last command avoids the parent-dir scan and only looks for the ".rsync-filter" files in each  directory  that  is  a
       part of the transfer.

       If you want to include the contents of a ".cvsignore" in your patterns, you should use the rule ":C", which creates a dir-merge of the .cvsignore
       file, but parsed in a CVS-compatible manner.  You can use this to affect where the ----ccvvss--eexxcclluuddee (--CC) option’s  inclusion  of  the  per-directory
       .cvsignore  file  gets  placed  into  your  rules  by putting the ":C" wherever you like in your filter rules.  Without this, rsync would add the
       dir-merge rule for the .cvsignore file at the end of all your other rules (giving it a lower priority than your command-line rules).   For  exam‐
       ple:

              cat <<EOT | rsync -avC --filter='. -' a/ b
              + foo.o
              :C
              - *.old
              EOT
              rsync -avC --include=foo.o -f :C --exclude='*.old' a/ b

       Both of the above rsync commands are identical.  Each one will merge all the per-directory .cvsignore rules in the middle of the list rather than
       at the end.  This allows their dir-specific rules to supersede the rules that follow the :C instead of being subservient to all your  rules.   To
       affect  the  other  CVS  exclude  rules  (i.e. the default list of exclusions, the contents of $HOME/.cvsignore, and the value of $CVSIGNORE) you
       should omit the --CC command-line option and instead insert a "-C" rule into your filter rules; e.g. "----ffiilltteerr==--CC".

       You can clear the current include/exclude list by using the "!" filter rule (as introduced in the FILTER RULES  section  above).   The  "current"
       list  is either the global list of rules (if the rule is encountered while parsing the filter options) or a set of per-directory rules (which are
       inherited in their own sub-list, so a subdirectory can use this to clear out the parent’s rules).

AANNCCHHOORRIINNGG IINNCCLLUUDDEE//EEXXCCLLUUDDEE PPAATTTTEERRNNSS
       As mentioned earlier, global include/exclude patterns are anchored at the "root of the transfer" (as opposed to per-directory patterns, which are
       anchored  at  the  merge-file’s  directory).  If you think of the transfer as a subtree of names that are being sent from sender to receiver, the
       transfer-root is where the tree starts to be duplicated in the destination directory.  This root governs where  patterns  that  start  with  a  /
       match.

       Because the matching is relative to the transfer-root, changing the trailing slash on a source path or changing your use of the ----rreellaattiivvee option
       affects the path you need to use in your matching (in addition to changing how much of the file tree is duplicated on the destination host).  The
       following examples demonstrate this.

       Let’s  say  that  we want to match two source files, one with an absolute path of "/home/me/foo/bar", and one with a path of "/home/you/bar/baz".
       Here is how the various command choices differ for a 2-source transfer:

              Example cmd: rsync -a /home/me /home/you /dest
              +/- pattern: /me/foo/bar
              +/- pattern: /you/bar/baz
              Target file: /dest/me/foo/bar
              Target file: /dest/you/bar/baz

              Example cmd: rsync -a /home/me/ /home/you/ /dest
              +/- pattern: /foo/bar               (note missing "me")
              +/- pattern: /bar/baz               (note missing "you")
              Target file: /dest/foo/bar
              Target file: /dest/bar/baz

              Example cmd: rsync -a --relative /home/me/ /home/you /dest
              +/- pattern: /home/me/foo/bar       (note full path)
              +/- pattern: /home/you/bar/baz      (ditto)
              Target file: /dest/home/me/foo/bar
              Target file: /dest/home/you/bar/baz

              Example cmd: cd /home; rsync -a --relative me/foo you/ /dest
              +/- pattern: /me/foo/bar      (starts at specified path)
              +/- pattern: /you/bar/baz     (ditto)
              Target file: /dest/me/foo/bar
              Target file: /dest/you/bar/baz

       The easiest way to see what name you should filter is to just look at the output when using ----vveerrbboossee and put a / in front of the name  (use  the
       ----ddrryy--rruunn option if you’re not yet ready to copy any files).

       Without  a  delete  option, per-directory rules are only relevant on the sending side, so you can feel free to exclude the merge files themselves
       without affecting the transfer.  To make this easy, the ’e’ modifier adds this exclude for you, as seen in these two equivalent commands:

              rsync -av --filter=': .excl' --exclude=.excl host:src/dir /dest
              rsync -av --filter=':e .excl' host:src/dir /dest

       However, if you want to do a delete on the receiving side AND you want some files to be excluded from being deleted, you’ll need to be sure  that
       the  receiving  side  knows  what  files  to  exclude.   The  easiest  way  is  to  include the per-directory merge files in the transfer and use
       ----ddeelleettee--aafftteerr, because this ensures that the receiving side gets all the same exclude rules as the sending side before it tries to  delete  any‐
       thing:

              rsync -avF --delete-after host:src/dir /dest

       However,  if  the merge files are not a part of the transfer, you’ll need to either specify some global exclude rules (i.e. specified on the com‐
       mand line), or you’ll need to maintain your own per-directory merge files on the receiving side.  An example of the first is  this  (assume  that
       the remote .rules files exclude themselves):

       rsync -av --filter=’: .rules’ --filter=’. /my/extra.rules’
          --delete host:src/dir /dest

       In the above example the extra.rules file can affect both sides of the transfer, but (on the sending side) the rules are subservient to the rules
       merged from the .rules files because they were specified after the per-directory merge rule.

       In one final example, the remote side is excluding the .rsync-filter files from the transfer, but we want to use our own .rsync-filter  files  to
       control  what  gets deleted on the receiving side.  To do this we must specifically exclude the per-directory merge files (so that they don’t get
       deleted) and then put rules into the local files to control what else should not get deleted.  Like one of these commands:

           rsync -av --filter=':e /.rsync-filter' --delete \
               host:src/dir /dest
           rsync -avFF --delete host:src/dir /dest

BBAATTCCHH MMOODDEE
       Batch mode can be used to apply the same set of updates to many identical systems. Suppose one has a tree which is  replicated  on  a  number  of
       hosts.   Now  suppose  some changes have been made to this source tree and those changes need to be propagated to the other hosts. In order to do
       this using batch mode, rsync is run with the write-batch option to apply the changes made to the source tree to one  of  the  destination  trees.
       The  write-batch  option  causes  the  rsync client to store in a "batch file" all the information needed to repeat this operation against other,
       identical destination trees.

       Generating the batch file once saves having to perform the file status, checksum, and data block generation more than once when updating multiple
       destination  trees.  Multicast  transport  protocols can be used to transfer the batch update files in parallel to many hosts at once, instead of
       sending the same data to every host individually.

       To apply the recorded changes to another destination tree, run rsync with the read-batch option, specifying the name of the same batch file,  and
       the destination tree.  Rsync updates the destination tree using the information stored in the batch file.

       For  your convenience, a script file is also created when the write-batch option is used:  it will be named the same as the batch file with ".sh"
       appended.  This script file contains a command-line suitable for updating a destination tree using the associated batch file. It can be  executed
       using  a  Bourne  (or Bourne-like) shell, optionally passing in an alternate destination tree pathname which is then used instead of the original
       destination path.  This is useful when the destination tree path on the current host differs from the one used to create the batch file.

       Examples:

              $ rsync --write-batch=foo -a host:/source/dir/ /adest/dir/
              $ scp foo* remote:
              $ ssh remote ./foo.sh /bdest/dir/

              $ rsync --write-batch=foo -a /source/dir/ /adest/dir/
              $ ssh remote rsync --read-batch=- -a /bdest/dir/ <foo

       In these examples, rsync is used to update /adest/dir/ from /source/dir/ and the information to repeat this operation  is  stored  in  "foo"  and
       "foo.sh".  The host "remote" is then updated with the batched data going into the directory /bdest/dir.  The differences between the two examples
       reveals some of the flexibility you have in how you deal with batches:

       o      The first example shows that the initial copy doesn’t have to be local -- you can push or pull data to/from a remote host using either the
              remote-shell syntax or rsync daemon syntax, as desired.

       o      The first example uses the created "foo.sh" file to get the right rsync options when running the read-batch command on the remote host.

       o      The  second  example reads the batch data via standard input so that the batch file doesn’t need to be copied to the remote machine first.
              This example avoids the foo.sh script because it needed to use a modified ----rreeaadd--bbaattcchh option, but you could edit the script file  if  you
              wished to make use of it (just be sure that no other option is trying to use standard input, such as the "----eexxcclluuddee--ffrroomm==--" option).

       Caveats:

       The  read-batch option expects the destination tree that it is updating to be identical to the destination tree that was used to create the batch
       update fileset.  When a difference between the destination trees is encountered the update might be discarded with a warning (if the file appears
       to  be  up-to-date  already) or the file-update may be attempted and then, if the file fails to verify, the update discarded with an error.  This
       means that it should be safe to re-run a read-batch operation if the command got interrupted.  If you wish to force the batched-update to  always
       be  attempted  regardless of the file’s size and date, use the --II option (when reading the batch).  If an error occurs, the destination tree will
       probably be in a partially updated state. In that case, rsync can be used in its regular (non-batch) mode of operation to fix up the  destination
       tree.

       The  rsync  version used on all destinations must be at least as new as the one used to generate the batch file.  Rsync will die with an error if
       the protocol version in the batch file is too new for the batch-reading rsync to handle.  See also the ----pprroottooccooll option for a way  to  have  the
       creating  rsync generate a batch file that an older rsync can understand.  (Note that batch files changed format in version 2.6.3, so mixing ver‐
       sions older than that with newer versions will not work.)

       When reading a batch file, rsync will force the value of certain options to match the data in the batch file if you didn’t set them to  the  same
       as  the  batch-writing  command.  Other options can (and should) be changed.  For instance ----wwrriittee--bbaattcchh changes to ----rreeaadd--bbaattcchh, ----ffiilleess--ffrroomm is
       dropped, and the ----ffiilltteerr/----iinncclluuddee/----eexxcclluuddee options are not needed unless one of the ----ddeelleettee options is specified.

       The code that creates the BATCH.sh file transforms any filter/include/exclude options into a single list that is appended as a "here" document to
       the shell script file.  An advanced user can use this to modify the exclude list if a change in what gets deleted by ----ddeelleettee is desired.  A nor‐
       mal user can ignore this detail and just use the shell script as an easy way to run the appropriate ----rreeaadd--bbaattcchh command for the batched data.

       The original batch mode in rsync was based on "rsync+", but the latest version uses a new implementation.

SSYYMMBBOOLLIICC LLIINNKKSS
       Three basic behaviors are possible when rsync encounters a symbolic link in the source directory.

       By default, symbolic links are not transferred at all.  A message "skipping non-regular" file is emitted for any symlinks that exist.

       If ----lliinnkkss is specified, then symlinks are recreated with the same target on the destination.  Note that ----aarrcchhiivvee implies ----lliinnkkss.

       If ----ccooppyy--lliinnkkss is specified, then symlinks are "collapsed" by copying their referent, rather than the symlink.

       Rsync can also distinguish "safe" and "unsafe" symbolic links.  An example where this might be used is a web site mirror that  wishes  to  ensure
       that the rsync module that is copied does not include symbolic links to //eettcc//ppaasssswwdd in the public section of the site.  Using ----ccooppyy--uunnssaaffee--lliinnkkss
       will cause any links to be copied as the file they point to on the destination.  Using ----ssaaffee--lliinnkkss will cause unsafe links to be  omitted  alto‐
       gether.  (Note that you must specify ----lliinnkkss for ----ssaaffee--lliinnkkss to have any effect.)

       Symbolic  links  are  considered  unsafe if they are absolute symlinks (start with //), empty, or if they contain enough ".." components to ascend
       from the directory being copied.

       Here’s a summary of how the symlink options are interpreted.  The list is in order of precedence, so if your combination of  options  isn’t  men‐

       rsync  occasionally  produces  error messages that may seem a little cryptic. The one that seems to cause the most confusion is "protocol version
       mismatch -- is your shell clean?".

       This message is usually caused by your startup scripts or remote shell facility producing unwanted garbage on the stream that rsync is using  for
       its transport. The way to diagnose this problem is to run your remote shell like this:

              ssh remotehost /bin/true > out.dat

       then look at out.dat. If everything is working correctly then out.dat should be a zero length file. If you are getting the above error from rsync
       then you will probably find that out.dat contains some text or data. Look at the contents and try to work out what is producing it. The most com‐
       mon cause is incorrectly configured shell startup scripts (such as .cshrc or .profile) that contain output statements for non-interactive logins.

       If  you  are  having  trouble debugging filter patterns, then try specifying the --vvvv option.  At this level of verbosity rsync will show why each
       individual file is included or excluded.

              Specify  a  non-zero numeric value if you want the ----pprrootteecctt--aarrggss option to be enabled by default, or a zero value to make sure that it is
              disabled by default. (First supported in 3.1.0.)

       RRSSYYNNCC__RRSSHH
              The RSYNC_RSH environment variable allows you to override the default shell used as the transport for rsync.   Command  line  options  are
              permitted after the command name, just as in the --ee option.

       RRSSYYNNCC__PPRROOXXYY
              The  RSYNC_PROXY  environment  variable allows you to redirect your rsync client to use a web proxy when connecting to a rsync daemon. You
              should set RSYNC_PROXY to a hostname:port pair.

       RRSSYYNNCC__PPAASSSSWWOORRDD
              Setting RSYNC_PASSWORD to the required password allows you to run authenticated rsync connections to an rsync daemon without  user  inter‐
              vention.  Note  that  this does not supply a password to a remote shell transport such as ssh; to learn how to do that, consult the remote
              shell’s documentation.

       UUSSEERR or LLOOGGNNAAMMEE
              The USER or LOGNAME environment variables are used to determine the default username sent to an rsync daemon.   If  neither  is  set,  the
              username defaults to "nobody".

       HHOOMMEE   The HOME environment variable is used to find the user’s default .cvsignore file.

       The  options  ----sseerrvveerr and ----sseennddeerr are used internally by rsync, and should never be typed by a user under normal circumstances.  Some awareness
       of these options may be needed in certain scenarios, such as when setting up a login that can only run an rsync command.  For instance, the  sup‐
       port directory of the rsync distribution has an example script named rrsync (for restricted rsync) that can be used with a restricted ssh login.
